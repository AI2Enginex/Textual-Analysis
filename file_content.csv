"
81,"well, to say this is my book would be totally untrue. at best, this was my dream. there are
"
82,"people in this world, some of them so wonderful, that made this dream become a product
"
83,"that you are holding in your hand. i would like to thank all of them, and in particular:
"
84,"shinie antony — mentor, guru and friend, who taught me the basics of telling a story and
"
85,"stayed with me right till the end. if she hadn’t encouraged and harassed me all the way, i
"
86,"would have given this up a long time ago.
"
87,"james turner, gaurav malik, jessica rosenberg, ritu malik, tracie ang, angela wang
"
88,"and rimjhim chattopadhya — amazing friends who read the manuscript and gave honest
"
89,"comments. all of them also stayed with me in the process, and handled me and my
"
90,"sometimes out-of-control emotions so well.
"
91,"anusha bhagat — a wife who was once a classmate, and was the first reader of the draft.
"
92,"apart from being shocked by some of the incidents in the book, she kept her calm as she had
"
93,"to face the tough job of improving the product and not upsetting her husband.
"
94,"my mom rekha bhagat and brother ketan, two people with an irrational, unbreakable
"
95,"belief in me that bordered on craziness at times. my relationship with them goes beyond the
"
96,"common genes we share, and i, like every author, needed their irrational support for me.
"
97,"my iit friends ashish (golu), johri, vk, manu, shanky, pappu, manhar, vp, rahul,
"
98,"mehta, pago, assem, rajeev g., rahul, lavmeet,puneet, chapar and all others. this is a
"
99,"work of fiction, but fiction needs real inspiration. i love them all so much that i could
"
100,"literally write a book on them. hey wait, have i?
"
101,"my friends in hong kong, my work colleagues, my yoga teachers and others that surround
"

"
103,"the editor and the entire team at rupa for being so professional and friendly through the
"
104,"process.
"
105,"and lastly, it 1s only when one writes a book that one realizes the true power of msword,
"
106,"from grammar checks to replace-alls. it is simple — without this software, this book would
"
107,"not be written. thank you mr bill gates and microsoft corp!
"
108," 
"
109,"prologue
"
110,"i had never been inside an ambulance before. it was kind of creepy. like a hospital was
"
111,"suddenly asked to pack up and move. instruments, catheters, drips and a medicine box
"
112,"surrounded two beds. there was hardly any space for me and ryan to stand even as alok
"
113,"got to sprawl out. i guess with thirteen fractures you kind of deserve a bed. the sheets were
"
114,"originally white, which was hard to tell now as alok’s blood covered every square inch of
"
115,"them. alok lay there unrecognizable, his eyeballs rolled up and his tongue collapsed outside
"
116,"his mouth like an old man without dentures. four front teeth gone, the doctor later told us.
"
117,"his limbs were motionless, just like his father’s right side, the right knee bent in a way
"
118,"that would make you think alok was boneless. he was still, and if i had to bet my money,
"
119,"i'd have said he was dead.
"
120,"“if alok makes it through this, i will write a book about our crazy days. i really will,” i
"
121,"swore. it is the kind of absurd promise you make to yourself when you are seriously messed
"
122,"up in the head and you haven’t slept for fifty hours straight...
"
123,"bare beginnings
"
124,"before i really begin this book, let me first tell you what this book is
"
125,"not. it 1s not a guide on how to live through college. on the contrary, it is probably an
"
126,"example of how screwed up your college years can get if you don’t think straight. but then
"
127,"this is my take on it, you’re free to agree or disagree. i expect ryan and alok, psychos both
"
128,"of them, will probably kill me after this but i don’t really care. i mean, if they wanted their
"
129,"version out there, they could have written one themselves. but alok cannot write for nuts,
"
130,"and ryan, even though he could really do whatever he wants, is too lazy to put his bum to
"
131,"the chair and type. so stuff it boys — it 1s my story, i am the one writing it and i get to tell it
"
132,"the way i want it.
"
133,"also, let me tell you one more thing this book is certainly not. this book will not help
"
134,"you get into iit. i think half the trees in the world are felled to make up the iit entrance
"
135,"exam guides. most of them are crap, but they might help you more than this one will.
"
136,"ryan, alok and i are probably the last people on earth you want to ask about getting into
"
137,"iit. all we would say as advice is, if you can lock yourself in a room with books for two
"
138,"years and throw away the key, you can probably make it here. and if your high school days
"
139,"were half as miserable as mine, disappearing behind a pile of books will not seem like such
"
140,"a bad idea. my last two years in school were living hell, and unless you captained the
"
141,"basketball team or played the electric guitar since age six, probably yours were too. but i
"
142,"don’t really want to get into all that.
"
143,"i think i have made my disclaimers, and it 1s time for me to commence.
"
144,"well, i have to start somewhere, and what better than the day i joined the indian institute of
"
145,"technology and met ryan and alok for the first time; we had adjacent rooms on the second
"
146,"floor of the kumaon hostel. as per tradition, seniors rounded us up on the balcony for
"
147,"ragging at midnight. i was still rubbing my eyes as the three of us stood to attention and three
"
148,"seniors faced us. a senior named anurag leaned against a wall. another senior, to my
"
149,"nervous eye, looked like a demon from cheap mythological tv shows — six feet tall, over a
"
150,"hundred kilos, dark, hairy, and huge teeth that were ten years late meeting an orthodontist.
"
151,"although he inspired terror, he spoke little and was busy providing background for the boss,
"
152,"baku, a lungi-clad human toothpick, and just as smelly is my guess.
"
153,"“you bloody freshers, dozing away eh? rascals, who will give an introduction?” he
"
154,"screamed.
"
155,"“t am hari kumar sir, mechanical engineering student, all india rank 326.” i was
"
156,"nothing if not honest under pressure.
"
157,"“t am alok gupta sir, mechanical engineering, rank 453,” alok said as i looked at him
"
158,"for the first time. he was my height, five feet five inches — in short, very short — and had
"
159,"these thick, chunky glasses on. his portly frame was covered in neatly ironed white kurta-
"
160,"pajamas.
"
161,"“ryan oberoi, mechanical engineering, rank 91, sir,” ryan said in a deep husky voice
"
162,"and all eyes swung to him.
"
163,"ryan oberoi, i repeated his name again mentally. now here was a guy you don’t see in
"
164,"iit too often; tall, with spare height, purposefully lean and unfairly handsome. a loose gray
"
165,"t-shirt proclaimed ‘gap’ in big blue letters on his chest and shiny black shorts reached his
"
166,"knees. relatives abroad for sure, i thought. nobody wears gap to bed otherwise.
"
167,"“you bastards,” baku was shrieking, “off with your clothes.”
"
168,"“aw baku, let us talk to them a bit first,” protested anurag, leaning against the wall,
"
169,"sucking a cigarette butt.
"
170,"“no talking!” baku said, one scrawny hand up. “no talking, just remove those damn
"
171,"clothes.”
"
172,"another demon grinned at us, slapping his bare stomach every few seconds. there
"
173,"seemed to be no choice so we surrendered every item of our clothing, shivering at the
"
174,"unholy glee in baku’s face as he walked by each of us, checking us out and grinning.
"
175,"nakedness made the difference between our bodies more stark as alok and me drew
"
176,"figures on the floor with deeply embarrassed toes, trying to be casual about our twisted
"
177,"balloon figures. ryan’s body was flawless, man, he was a hunk; muscles that cut at the right
"
178,"places and a body frame that for once resembled the human body shown in biology books.
"
179,"you could describe his body as sculpture. alok and i, on the other hand, weren’t exactly
"
180,"what you’d call art.
"
181,"baku told alok and me to step forward, so the seniors could have better view and a
"
182,"bigger laugh.
"
183,"“look at them, mothers fed them until they are ready to explode, little farex babies,”
"
184,"baku cackled.
"
185,"the demon joined him in laughter. anurag smiled behind a burst of smoke as he
"
186,"extinguished another cigarette, creating his own special effects.
"
187,"“sir, please sir, let us go sir,” alok pleaded to baku as he came closer.
"
188,"“what? let you go? we haven’t even done anything yet to you beauties. c’mon bend
"
189,"down on all fours now, you two fatsos.”
"
190,"i looked at alok’s face. his eyes were invisible behind those thick, bulletproof
"
191,"spectacles, but going by his contorted face, i could tell he was as close to tears as i was.
"
192,"“c’mon, do what he says,” the demon admonished. he and baku seemed to share a
"
193,"symbiotic relationship; baku needed him for brute strength, while the servile demon needed
"
194,"him for directions.
"
195,"alok and i bent down on all fours. more laughter, this time from above our heads, ensued.
"
196,"the demon suggested racing both of us, his first original opinion in a while but baku
"
197,"overrode him.
"
198,"“no racing-vacing, i have a better idea. just wait, i have to go to my room. and you
"
199,"naked cows, don’t look up.”
"
200,"baku raced up the corridor as we waited for twenty tense seconds, gazing at the floor. i
"
201,"glanced sideways and noticed a small water puddle adjacent to alok’s head, droplets
"
202,"falling from his eye.
"
203,"meanwhile, the demon made ryan flex his muscles and make warrior poses. i am sure he
"
204,"looked photogenic, but didn’t dare look up to verify.
"
205,"our ears picked up baku’s hurried steps as he returned.
"
206,"“look what i got,” he said, holding up his hands.
"
207,"“baku, what the hell is that for...?’ anurag enquired as we turned our heads up.
"
208,"in each of his hands, baku held an empty coke bottle. “take a wild guess,” he said as he
"
209,"clanged the bottles together, making suggestive gestures.
"
210,"face turning harder, arms still 1n modelling pose, ryan spoke abruptly, “sir, what exactly
"
211,"are you trying to do?”
"
212,"“what, isn’t it obvious? and who the hell are you to ask me?” choked baku.
"
213,"“sir, stop,” ryan said, in a louder voice.
"
214,"“fuck off,” baku dismissed, disbelief writ large in his widened eyes at this blatant
"
215,"rebellion against his age-old authority.
"
216,"as baku put the bottles in position, ryan abandoned his pin-up pose and jumped.
"
217,"catching him unawares, he grabbed the two bottles and stamped hard on baku’s feet. baku
"
218,"released his hands and the bottles were with ryan, james bond style.
"
219,"we knew that stomp hurt since baku’s scream was ultrasonic.
"
220,"“get this bastard,” baku shrieked in agony.
"
221,"the demon’s iq was clouded by the events but his ears registered the command for action
"
222,"and he had just collected himself in response when ryan smashed the two coke bottles on
"
223,"the balcony parapet. each bottle now was butt-broken, and he waved the jagged ends in air.
"
224,"“come, you bastards,” ryan swore, his face scarlet like a watermelon slice. baku and the
"
225,"demon retreated a few paces. anurag, who had been smouldering in the backdrop, snapped
"
226,"to attention. “hey, cool it everyone here. how did this happen? what 1s your name - ryan,
"
227,"take it easy man. this is just fun.”
"
228,"“tt’s not fun for me,” growled ryan, “just get the hell out of here.”
"
229,"alok and i looked at each other. i was hoping ryan knew what he was doing. i mean sure,
"
230,"he was saving our ass froma coke bottle, but broken coke bottles could be a lot worse.
"
231,"“listen yaar,’ anurag started as ryan cut him short.
"
232,"“just get lost,” ryan shouted so hard that baku seemed to blow away just from the
"
233,"impact. actually, he was shuffling backward slowly and steadily till he was almost flying in
"
234,"his haste to get away, the demon following suit. anurag stood there gaping at ryan for a
"
235,"while and then looked at us.
"
236,"“tell him to control himself. or one day he will take you guys down too,” anurag said.
"
237,"alok and i got up and wore our clothes.
"
238,"“thanks ryan, i was really scared,” alok said, as he removed his spectacles to wipe snot
"
239,"and tears, face to face with his hero at last.
"
240,"there is a reason why they say men should not cry, they just look so, like, ugly. alok’s
"
241,"spectacles were sad enough, but his baby-wet blubbery eyes were enough to depress you
"
242,"into suicide.
"
243,"“yes, thanks ryan, some risk you took there. that baku guy 1s sick. though you think they
"
244,"would have done anything?” i said, striving for a cool i did not feel.
"
245,"“who knows? maybe not,” ryan rotated a shoulder, “but you can never tell when guys
"
246,"get into mob mentality. trust me, i have lived in enough boarding schools.”
"
247,"ryan’s heroics were enough to make us all bond faster than fevicol. besides, we were
"
248,"hostelite neighbours and in the same engineering department. they say you should not get
"
249,"into a relationship with people you sleep with on the first date. well, though we hadn’t slept
"
250,"together, we had seen each other naked at primary meet, so perhaps we should have
"
251,"refrained from striking up a friendship. but our troika was kind of inevitable.
"
252,"“m-a-c-h-i-n-e,” the blackboard proclaimed in big bold letters.
"
253,"as we entered the amphitheatre-shaped lecture room, we grabbed a pile of handouts
"
254,"each. the instructor sat next to the blackboard like a bloated beetle, watching us settle
"
255,"down, waiting for the huddled murmurs to cease.
"
256,"he appeared around forty years of age, with gray hair incandescent from three
"
257,"tablespoons of coconut oil, wore an un-tucked light blue shirt and had positioned three pens
"
258,"in his front pocket, along with chalks, like an array of bullets.
"
259,"“welcome everyone. i am professor dubey, mechanical engineering department... so,
"
260,"first day in college. do you feel special?” he said in a monotone.
"
261,"the class remained silent. we were busy scanning our handouts and feeling like a herd.
"
262,"the course was manufacturing processes, often shortened to manpro for easier
"
263,"pronunciation. the handouts consisted of the course outline. contents covered the basic
"
264,"techniques of manufacturing — such as welding, machining, casting, bending and shaping.
"
265,"along with the outline, the handout contained the grading pattern of the course.
"
266,"majors — 40%
"
267,"minors — 20%
"
268,"practicals — 20%
"
269,"assignments (6-8) and surprise quizzes (3-4) — 20%
"
270,"prof dubey noticed the limp response to his greeting and made his voice more exuberant.
"
271,"“look at the handout later. don’t worry, you will get enough of these, one for every course.
"
272,"put them aside now,” he said as he stood up and walked toward the blackboard.
"
273,"he took out a chalk from his pocket with a flourish celluloid-terrorists reserved for hand-
"
274,"grenades and underlined the word ‘machine’ approximately six times. then he turned to us.
"
275,"“machine, the basic reason for existence of any mechanical engineer. everything you learn
"
276,"finds application in machines. now, can anyone tell me what a machine 1s?”
"
277,"the class fell even more silent. that’s the first lesson: various degrees of silence.
"
278,"“anyone?” the professor asked again as he started walking through the rows of students.
"
279,"as the students on the aisles felt even more stalked and avoided eye contact, i turned around
"
280,"to study my new classmates. there must have been seventy of us in this class, three hundred
"
281,"of us in a batch. i noticed a boy in front of me staring at the instructor intently, his head
"
282,"moving to and fro, mouth ajar; a timid sort, whom baku could polish off for snack any given
"
283,"day.
"
284,"“you,” prof dubey chose me as his first casualty.
"
285,"it was the first time the condition struck me, where tongue cleaves unto dental roof, body
"
286,"freezes, blood vessels rupture and sweat bursts out in buckets.
"
287,"“you, iam talking to you,” the professor clarified.
"
288,"“hari, hari..”” somebody inside me called but could only get my answering machine. i
"
289,"could have attempted an answer, or at least a silly ‘i don’t know’ but it was as if my mouth
"
290,"was awol.
"
291,"“strange,” surmised prof dubey dubiously as he moved to another student.
"
292,"“you in the check shirt. what do you think?”
"
293,"check shirt had hitherto been pretending to take notes to escape the professor’s glance.
"
294,"“sir, machine sir...1s a device... like big parts... sir like big gears and all...”
"
295,"“what?” prof dubey’s disgust fell like spit on check shirt. “see, the standard just keeps
"
296,"falling every year. our admission criteria are just not strict enough.” he shook his oiled
"
297,"skull, the one that contained all the information in this planet, including the definition of
"
298,"machines.
"
299,"“yeah, right. busted my butt for two years for this damn place. one in hundred 1s not
"
300,"good enough for them,” ryan whispered to me.
"
301,"“shshh,” ordered prof dubey, looking at the three of us, “anyway, the definition of a
"
302,"machine 1s simple. it is anything that reduces human effort. anything. so, see the world
"
303,"around you and it 1s full of machines.”
"
304,"anything that reduces human effort, i repeated in my head. well, that sounded simple
"
305,"enough.
"
306,"“so, from huge steel mills, to simple brooms, man has invented so much to reduce human
"
307,"effort,” the professor continued, as he noticed the class was mesmerized by his simple
"
308,"clarification.
"
309,"“airplane?” said one student in the front row.
"
310,"“machine,” instructor said.
"
311,"“stapler,” suggested another.
"
312,"“machine.”
"
313,"it really was amazing. a spoon, car, blender, knife, chair — students threw examples at the
"
314,"professor and there was only one answer — machine.
"
315,"“fall in love with the world around you,” prof dubey smiled for the first time, “for you
"
316,"will become the masters of machines.”
"
317,"a feeling of collective joy darted through the class for having managed to convert prof
"
318,"dubey’s sour expression into smiles.
"
319,"“sir, what about a gym machine, like a bench press or something?” ryan interrupted the
"
320,"bonhomie.
"
321,"“what about it?” prof dubey stopped beaming.
"
322,"“that doesn’t reduce human effort. in fact, it increases it.”
"
323,"the class fell silent again.
"
324,"“well, i mean...” prof dubey said as he scouted for arguments.
"
325,"boy, did ryan really have a point?
"
326,"“perhaps it is too simple a definition then?” ryan said in a pseudo-helpful voice.
"
327,"“what are you trying to do?” the professor asked tight-lipped as he came close to us
"
328,"again, “are you saying that i am wrong?”
"
329,"“no sir, ?m just...”
"
330,"“watch it son. in my class, just watch it,” was all prof dubey said as he moved to the
"
331,"front.
"
332,"“okay, enough fun. now, let us focus on manpro,” he said as he rubbed off the word
"
333,"‘machine’ from the blackboard and the six underlines below it, “my course is very
"
334,"important. i am sure many professors will tell you about their courses. but i care about
"
335,"manrpro. so, don’t miss class, finish your assignments and be prepared, a surprise quiz can
"

337,"he went on to tackle casting, one of the oldest methods of working with metal. after an
"
338,"hour on how iron melts and foundry workers pour it into sand moulds, he ended the session.
"
339,"“that is it for today. best of luck once again for your stay here. remember, as your head
"
340,"of department prof cherian says, the tough workload 1s by design, to keep you on your toes.
"
341,"and respect the grading system. you get bad grades, and i assure you — you get no job, no
"
342,"school and no future. if you do well, the world is your oyster. so, don’t slip, not even once,
"
343,"or there will be no oyster, just slush.”
"
344,"a shiver ran through all of us as with that quote the professor slammed the duster on the
"
345,"desk and walked away in a cloud of chalk.

346,"terminator
"
347,"they say time flies when you are having fun. in the first semester alone,
"
348,"with six courses, four of them with practical classes, time dragged so slow and comatose,
"
349,"fun was conspicuous by its absence. every day, from eight to five, we were locked in the
"
350,"eight-storey insti-building with lectures, tutorials and labs. the next few hours of the
"
351,"evening were spent in the library or in our rooms as we prepared reports and finished
"
352,"assignments. and this did not even include the tests! each subject had two minor tests, one
"
353,"major and three surprise quizzes; seven tests for six courses meant forty-two tests per
"
354,"semester, mathematically speaking. luckily, the professors spared us surprise quizzes in the
"
355,"first month, citing ragging season and the settling-in period of course; but the ragging season
"
356,"ended soon and it meant a quiz could happen any time. in ever y class we had to look out for
"
357,"instructor ’s subtle hints about a possible quiz in the next class.
"
358,"meanwhile, i got better acquainted with ryan and alok. ryan’s dad had this handicraft
"
359,"business that was essentially a sweatshop for potters that made vases for the european
"
360,"market. ryan’s father and mother were both intimately involved in the business and their
"
361,"regular travel meant ryan stayed in boarding school, a plush colonial one in hill-town
"
362,"mussoorie.
"
363,"alok’s family, i guess, was of limited means, which is just a polite way of saying he was
"
364,"poor. his mother was the only earning member, and last i heard, schoolteachers didn’t
"
365,"exactly hit dirt on pay-day. besides, half her salary regularly went to support her husband’s
"
366,"medical treatment. at the same time, alok’s elder sister was getting near what he mournfully
"
367,"called ‘marriageable age’, another cause of major worry for his household. going by alok’s
"
368,"looks i guess she wasn’t breathtakingly beautiful either.
"
369,"i also got familiar with kumaon and other wing-mates. i won’t go into all of them, but in
"
370,"one corner there was sukhwinder or the “happy surd’ since his face broke into sunny smiles
"
371,"at proximity with anything remotely human. next to him was the studious venkat, who
"
372,"coated his windows with thick black paper and stayed locked inside alone. there was
"
373,"‘itchy’ rajesh whose hands were always scratching some part of his body, sometimes in
"
374,"objectionable places. on the other side of the hallway were seniors’ rooms, including baku,
"
375,"anurag and other animals.
"
376,"ryan, alok and i often studied together in the evenings. one month into the first semester,
"
377,"we were sitting in my room chasing a quanto-physics assignment deadline.
"
378,"“damn,” ryan said as he got up his easy chair to stretch his spectacular spine. “what a
"
379,"crazy week; classes, assignments, more classes, assignments and not to mention the coming-
"
380,"attraction quizzes. you call this a life?”
"
381,"alok sat on the study desk, focused on the physics assignment, head bent down and
"
382,"sideways, just two inches above his sheet. he always writes this way, head near the sheet,
"
383,"pen pressed tight between his fingers, his white worksheets reflected on his thick glasses.
"
384,"“wha...” alok looked up, sounding retarded.
"
385,"“t said you call this a life?” ryan asked, this time looking at me.
"
386,"i was sitting on the bed cross-legged, attempting the assignment on a drawing board. i
"
387,"needed a break, so i put my pen down.
"
388,"“call it what you want,” i said, words stifled by a titanic yawn, “but that 1s not going to
"
389,"change it.”
"
390,"“t think this 1s jail. it really 1s. damn jail,” ryan said, hitting the peeling wall witha fist.
"
391,"“maybe you're forgetting that you’re in iit, the best college in the country,” alok said,
"
392,"cracking knuckles.
"
393,"“so? you put students in jail?” ryan asked, hands on hips.
"
394,"“no. but you expect a certain standard,” alok said, putting his hand up to indicate height.
"
395,"“this 1s high standard? working away like moronic drones until midnight. manpro
"
396,"yesterday, apmech day before, quanto today...it never ends,” ryan grumbled. “i need a
"
397,"break, man. anyone for a movie?”
"
398,"“and what about the assignment?” alok blinked.
"
399,"“priya has 7erminator on,” ryan beguiled.
"
400,"“then when will we sleep?” alok said.
"
401,"“you are one real muggu eh?” ryan said indulgently to him.
"
402,"“tl go,” i said, keeping my drawing board aside, “come alok, we’ll do it later.”
"
403,"“tt will get late, man,” alok warned half-heartedly.
"
404,"i stood up and took his pen, put it into his geometry box. yes, alok had a geometry box,
"
405,"like he was about twelve years old.
"
406,"“come get up,” i said when i noticed two paintbrushes in his box. “hey, what are the
"
407,"paintbrushes for?”
"
408,"“nothing,” alok mumbled.
"
409,"i lifted the brushes, painting imaginary arcs in air. “then why do you have them? to give
"
410,"colour to your circuit diagrams?” i laughed at my own joke, waving the brushes in the air.
"
411,"“or to express your soul in the manpro class? to draw prof dubey’s frowny face?”
"
412,"“no. actually, they are my father’s. he was an artist, but he’s paralyzed now.”
"
413,"there are times in life you wish dinosaurs weren’t extinct and could be whistled to come
"
414,"and gulp you down. i went motionless, fingers 1n mid-air.
"
415,"ryan saw my face and pressed his teeth together to be simultaneously tch-tch sympathetic
"
416,"to alok and stop laughing at me. “really alok? that’s really sad. ’'m sorry man,” he said,
"
417,"putting his hand around alok’s shoulder. the bastard, scoring over me for no fault of mine.
"
418,"“tt’s okay. it was a long while ago. we are used to him like that now,” alok said, finally
"
419,"getting up for the movie while i was still hoping i’'d evaporate.
"
420,"when we walked out, ryan was with alok, me trailing six steps behind.
"
421,"“well, i have lived in boarding school all my life, so i can’t really understand. but 1t must
"
422,"be pretty difficult for you. i mean how did you manage?” ryan continued.
"
423,"“barely managed actually. my mother is a biology teacher. that was the only income.
"
424,"elder sister is still in college.”
"
425,"i nodded my head, trying desperately to evince how empathetic to his cause i was, too.
"
426,"“how do you think i got into iit? i was taking care of him for the past two years,” alok
"
427,"said.
"
428,"“really?” i said, finally getting my chance to get into the conversation.
"
429,"“yes, every day after school i was nursing him and reading my books.”
"
430,"ryan had a scooter, which made it easy for us to get to priya. it was illegal for three
"
431,"people to ride together in a triple sandwich, but cops rarely demanded more than twenty
"
432,"bucks if they stopped you. chances of getting caught were less than one in ten, so ryan said
"
433,"it was still cheap on a probability weighted basis.
"
434,"priya cinema at night was a completely different world from our quiet campus. families,
"
435,"couples and groups of young people lined up to catch the hit movie of the season. we bought
"
436,"front row tickets, as alok did not want to spend too much. personally, i think he was just too
"
437,"blind to sit far away. in any case, the movie was science fiction, which i should have
"
438,"guessed given ryan’s choice; he always picked sci-fi movies. i hate sci-fi movies, but who
"
439,"asks me? this one had time travel, human robots, laser guns, the works, presented in an
"
440,"unfunny way. in ten minutes, the obscenely muscular hero’s heroics looked too silly to even
"
441,"smirk at, and i was yawning uncontrollably.
"
442,"“wow!” ryan said, bringing his hand to his face as the villain launched a torpedo from
"
443,"his backpack.
"
444,"“what the hell do you see in these movies?” i whispered, just to jack his trip.
"
445,"“man, look at all those gadgets.”
"
446,"“but they’re all fake. it is fiction.”
"
447,"“yes, but we could have them one day.”
"
448,"“time travel? you really think we could have time travel?” ryan’s ridiculous when he
"
449,"gets excited.
"
450,"“hush, it’s hard enough to understand the accent guys,” alok objected.
"
451,"when we returned to kumaon at midnight, our asses were set on fire, i mean not literally,
"
452,"but everyone from venkat to sukhwinder were running around with notepads and textbooks.
"
453,"“surprise quiz. strong rumour of one in apmech,” happy surd explained as he furiously
"
454,"riffled through his notes, for once not electrified at our company.
"
455,"apmech was applied mechanics, and apparently, some student in nilgiri hostel had
"
456,"visited the professor’s office in the evening to submit a late assignment. the professor had
"
457,"sinisterly advised to “keep revising your notes”, waggling left eyebrow at the same time.
"
458,"enough to ring the alarm as news travelled through the campus like wildfire.
"
459,"“damn. now we have to study for apmech. it will take hours,” alok said morosely.
"
460,"“and we have the quanto assignment to finish as well,” i reminded.
"
461,"everyone gathered in my room to study. it was at two in the morning that alok spoke.
"
462,"“this whole movie thing was a dumb idea, i told you.”
"
463,"“how was i to know? anyway, why are you taking arbit tension?” ryan took offence.
"
464,"“tt is not arbit. it’s relative grading here, so if we don’t study and others do, we are
"
465,"screwed,” alok said, stressing the last word so hard even ryan was startled.
"
466,"just then, a mouse darted out from under my bed.
"
467,"“did you see that?” ryan said, eager to change the topic. he removed his slippers,
"
468,"hoping to take aim and strike the rodent down. however, the rodent had other ideas on his
"
469,"own demise and dived diplomatically back under the bed.
"
470,"“yes, there are these creepy mice in my room. little bastards,” i said, almost
"
471,"affectionately.
"
472,"“you want me to kill them for you?” ryan offered.
"
473,"“tt’s not that easy. they are too smart and quick,” i said.
"
474,"“challenge?” ryan said.
"
475,"“t beg you brothel-borns, not now. can we please study?” alok said, literally folding his
"
476,"hands. the guy 1s too dramatic.
"
477,"ryan eased back into the chair and wore his footwear. he opened the apmech book and
"
478,"exhaled deep through his mouth.
"
479,"“yes sir, let us mug and cram. otherwise, how will we become great engineers of this
"
480,"great country,” ryan mock-sighed.
"
481,"“shut up,” alok said, his face already immersed in his workbook.
"
482,"ryan did shut up after that, even though he kept bending to look under the bed from time to
"
483,"time. i was sure he wanted to get at least one mouse, but the little creatures smartly
"
484,"maintained a low profile. we finished our quanto assignment 1n an hour and then revised the
"
485,"apmech notes until five, by which time ryan was snoring soundly, i was struggling to stay
"
486,"awake and even alok’s eyes had started watering. we still had around a third of the course
"
487,"left, but it was necessar y to catch some sleep. besides, the quiz was only a rumour, we did
"
488,"not know if 1t would actually materialize.
"
489,"but rumours, especially ugly ones, have a way of coming true. thirty minutes into the
"
490,"apmech class, prof sen locked the door and opened his black briefcase. “time for some
"
491,"fun. here is a quickie quiz of multiple choice questions,” he said.
"
492,"prof sen passed the handouts to the front row students, who in turn cascaded them
"
493,"backward. everyone in class knew about the rumour, and the quiz was as much a surprise as
"
494,"snow in siberia. i took the question sheet and glanced over the questions. most of them
"
495,"were from recent lectures, the part of the course we could not revise.
"
496,"“crap. we never got to the lectures for question five onward,” i whispered to alok.
"
497,"“we are screwed. let’s get screwed in silence at least,” he said as he placed his head in
"
498,"his ‘study’ position, left cheek almost touching the answer sheet.
"
499,"we never discussed the quiz upon our return to kumaon that day. other students were
"
500,"talking animatedly about some questions being out of course. obviously, we never finished
"
501,"the course, so we did not know better. we did not have to wait for results too long either.
"
502,"prof sen distributed the answer sheets in class two days later.
"
503,"“five? i got a five out of twenty,” i said to alok, who sat next to me in class.
"
504,"“t got seven. damn it, seven,” alok said.
"
505,"“t have three. how about that? one, two, three,” ryan said, counting on his fingers.
"
506,"prof sen wrote the customary summary scores on the blackboard.
"
507,"average: 11/20
"
508,"high: 17/20
"
509,"low: 3/20
"
510,"he kept those written for a few minutes, before proceeding with his lecture on cantilever
"
511,"beams.
"
512,"“t have the lowest. did you see that?” ryan whispered to me, unmoved by cantilever
"
513,"beams. it was hard to figure out what he was feeling at this point. even though he was trying
"
514,"to stay calm and expressionless, i could tell he was having trouble digesting his result. he
"
515,"re-read his quiz, it did not change the score.
"
516,"alok was in a different orbit. his face looked like it had on ragging day. he viewed the
"
517,"answer sheet like he had the coke bottle, an expression of anxiety mixed with sadness. it’s in
"
518,"these moments that alok is most vulnerable, you nudge him just a little bit and you know
"
519,"he’d cry. but for now, the quiz results were a repulsive enough sight.
"
520,"i saw my own answer sheet. the instructor had written my score in big but careless
"
521,"letters, like graffiti written with contempt. now i am no einstein or anything, but this never
"
522,"happened to me in school. my score was five on twenty, or twenty-five per cent; i had never
"
523,"in my life scored less than three times as much. ouch, the first quiz in iit hurt.
"
524,"but take ryan’s scores. i wondered if it had been worth it for him to even study last night.
"
525,"i was two points ahead of him, or wait a minute, sixty-six per cent ahead of him, that made
"
526,"me feel better. thank god for relative misery!
"
527,"alok had the highest percentage amongst the three of us, but i could tell he did not find
"
528,"solace in our misery. he saw his score, and he saw the average on the board. i saw his face,
"
529,"twisting every time he saw his wrong answers.
"
530,"we kept our answer sheets, the proof of our underperformance, in our bags and strolled
"
531,"back to kumaon. we met at dinner in the mess. the food was insipid as usual, and alok
"
532,"wrinkled his pug nose as he dispiritedly plopped a thick blob of green substance mess-
"
533,"workers called bhindi masala into his plate. he slammed two rotis on his stainless steel
"
534,"plate and ignored the rest of the semi-solid substances like dal, raita and pulao. ryan and i
"
535,"took everything; though everything tasted the same, we could at least have some variety of
"
536,"colors on our plate.
"
537,"alok finally brought up the topic of the quiz at the dinner table.
"
538,"“so, now you don’t have anything to say?”
"
539,"ryan and i looked at each other.
"
540,"“say what?” i said.
"
541,"“that how crap this is,” alok said.
"
542,"“the food?” i said, fully aware alok meant otherwise.
"
543,"“no damn it! not the damn food,” alok said, “the apmech quiz.” his expression
"
544,"changed from the usual tragic one to a livelier angry one. i found that expression marginally
"
545,"more pleasant to look at and easier to deal with.
"
546,"“what about the quiz? we’re screwed. what is to discuss in that?” ryan simplified.
"
547,"“oh really. we are screwed, no damn doubt in that,” alok said.
"
548,"i think alok picks up a word and uses it too much, which ruins the effect. there were too
"
549,"many ‘damns’ in his dialogue.
"
550,"“then drop it. anyway, you got the highest amongst us. so, be happy.”
"
551,"“happy? yes, iam happy. the average is eleven, and someone got seventeen. and here i
"
552,"am, at damn seven. yes, iam happy my damn terminator ass,” alok scoffed.
"
553,"i told you, alok ruins the effect. i wanted to tell him that he should stop ‘damn’ right now
"
554,"but something told me he would not appreciate the subtleties of cursing right now.
"
555,"“what? what did you just say?” ryan said, keeping his spoon down on the plate, “did
"
556,"you say /erminator?”
"
557,"“yes. it was a stupid idea. your stupid damn idea,” alok said.
"
558,"ryan froze. he looked at alok as if he was speaking in foreign tongue. then he turned
"
559,"toward me. “you heard what he said? hari, you heard? this is unbelievable man.”
"
560,"i had heard alok, nothing being the matter with my eardrums but i wasn’t paying attention
"
561,"to anything apart from keeping count of the ‘damns’.
"
562,"“hari, you think i screwed up the quiz?” ryan asked slowly.
"
563,"i looked at alok’s and ryan’s faces in quick succession. “ryan, you got three. you still
"
564,"need me to tell you that you screwed up?” i counter-questioned, mediating on something i
"
565,"did not understand yet.
"
566,"“no. i mean alok is saying i screwed up the quiz for both of you because i took you to the
"
567,"movie. you think so or... ?”
"
568,"“that is not what i said...” alok interrupted even as ryan raised his hand to indicate
"
569,"silence.
"
570,"i understood ryan’s question now, but i did not know how to answer it, without taking
"
571,"sides.
"
572,"“but how does that... .”
"
573,"“no, hari tell me. is that what you expect your best friends to say?” ryan asked.
"
574,"“tt is not important. and besides, you did not drag us forcibly to see that crap movie,” i
"
575,"said, reminding myself to never see sci-fi again.
"
576,"ryan was satisfied with the answer. he relaxed his raised hand and smiled, “see, there
"
577,"you go.”
"
578,"“but alok is right too. we should have a limit on the fun factor. you can’t screw with the
"
579,"system too much, it comes back to screw you — the quiz is an example.”
"
580,"“thank you sir,” alok said, “that is exactly what i am saying.”
"
581,"cool, i had managed to come out clean in this one. sometimes, if you just paraphrase
"
582,"everyone’s arguments, you get to be the good guy.
"
583,"barefoot on metal
"
584,"the quiz mishap reinvigorated our commitment to studies for a while.
"
585,"ryan was quieter when we studied in the rooms, controlling his urge to discuss emergency
"
586,"topics ranging from movies to food to new sci-fi movies, leading to more productive study
"
587,"sessions. though our scores moved closer to class average, assignments can get dull as hell
"
588,"after a while, and you need a break. ryan often dozed off between assignments, or stared
"
589,"unseeingly at the wall, whispering curses frequently every time he opened a new book.
"
590,"“okay then,” he sighed one day, stapling his assignment. “i have finished today’s crap.
"
591,"you guys going to mug more or what?”
"
592,"“why are you always calling this crap?” alok asked, perplexed.
"
593,"“take a wild guess,” ryan said, tossing his assignment on the table like a used tissue.
"
594,"“but why?” alok said, “i mean, surely you studied a lot to get into iit right?”
"
595,"“yes, but frankly, this place has let me down. this isn’t exactly the cutting edge of
"
596,"science and technology as they describe themselves, is it?”
"
597,"i closed my book to join in the conversation. “boss, mugging 1s the price one pays to get
"
598,"the iit tag. you mug, you pass and you get job. what let-down are you talking about?”
"
599,"“that is the problem, there is this stupid system and there are stupid people like you.”
"
600,"i hate ryan. when he is on his own trip, we all turn stupid.
"
601,"“continuous mugging, testing and assignments. where is the time to try out new ideas?
"
602,"just sit all day and get fat like hari.”
"
603,"ryan doesn’t like mugging, therefore, i am stupid and fat. people like him think they are
"
604,"god’s gifts to the world. what’s worse, they are.
"
605,"“t don’t have any new ideas. and i am not that fat, am i?” i said turning to alok. looking
"
606,"at him i instantly felt better.
"
607,"“fatso, look into a mirror. you should do something about it.”
"
608,"“tt 1s genetic, saw a tv documentary once,” i defended weakly.
"
609,"“genetic, my ass. i can make you lose ten kilos like that.” he snapped his fingers.
"
610,"i did not know where ryan was going with this, but it could not have been pleasant for
"
611,"me. being fat was more appealing to me than running behind the insti bus or climbing the
"
612,"stairs of these buildings fifty times a day. “ryan, forget about me. if you don’t want to mug,
"
613,"should we go to the canteen for a parantha?”
"
614,"“boss, this is the problem — all food and no exercise. i’ve decided, hari has to go on an
"
615,"exercise routine,” ryan said, jumping up. “we start tomorrow morning then.”
"
616,"ryan decided for other people. i don’t know if it was his good looks or just his good-
"
617,"natured vanity that you didn’t want to prick, but mostly he got away with it.
"
618,"“wait ryan, what the...” i began.
"
619,"“actually, alok you should come, too. interested?”
"
620,"“go to hell,” alok muttered as he dived back into his books like a squirrel with a nut.
"
621,"i thought about losing ten kilos. all my life people had called me fat-man, to the point
"
622,"where plumpness was part of my identity now. of course, i hated that part of my identity and
"
623,"ryan did seem to know what he was doing, and his own body was great. heck, i thought, it
"
624,"was worth a try.
"
625,"“what do i have to do?” i capitulated.
"
626,"“early morning jogs around the whole campus, around four kilometers.”
"
627,"no way, i can’t even walk four kilometers,” i dismissed.
"
628,"“you wimp, at least try. you’ll feel great afterwards,” ryan said.
"
629,"sure enough, ryan mercilessly kicked at my door at five a.m. sharp the next morning. i
"
630,"hate ryan. anyway, i opened the door and he stood there waiting for me to change into t-
"
631,"shirt and shorts.
"
632,"“four kilometers?” i was drowsy and pitiful at the same time.
"
633,"“try, just try,” ryan enthused.
"
634,"it was still dark outside when i left kumaon. i was happy for that small mercy — no one
"
635,"would see an eighty-kilo globe-shaped creature bouncing along the road. to do the four-
"
636,"kilometer route meant reaching the other end of campus, past the hostels, sports grounds,
"
637,"insti building and the faculty housing. i thought i could cheat and cut corners, but i wanted to
"
638,"give ryan a chance, not that i hated him any less for it.
"
639,"my entire body groaned as muscles i never knew existed made themselves known. in ten
"
640,"minutes, i was panting like a trekker on mount everest without oxygen, and in fifteen, i felt a
"
641,"heart attack coming on. i panted for a few minutes and started again till i passed the insti
"
642,"building and was 1n the faculty-housing colony.
"
643,"dawn broke, revealing manicured lawns and picture postcard bungalows of our
"
644,"tormentors in class. i passed prof dubey’s house. it was hard to imagine this man out of
"
645,"class, living in a home, watching tv, peeing, eating at a dining table. by now, i was wet
"
646,"with sweat and my face beyond red, reaching rare shades of purple.
"
647,"i stopped, huffing and puffing, when i went bump at the knees. stumbling at the
"
648,"unexpected impact, i kind of whooshed forward, extending my hands just in time to save
"
649,"myself from a bad fall. i sat stunned on the road, recovering from the shock and
"
650,"breathlessness, and then turned around.
"
651,"a red maruti car was the culprit! i continued panting as i squinted my eyes to see the
"
652,"driver through the windscreen. who was trying to kill me when i was already dying? 1
"
653,"wondered, waiting for my breath to return to normal.
"
654,"“t am so-so sorry,” a female voice announced. a young girl, around my age, in a loose t-
"
655,"shirt and knee-length shorts, clothes that one usually wore at home. she skipped forward in
"
656,"a silly way, which was probably her attempt to run toward me. i noticed she was barefoot.
"
657,"“tam so sorry. are you all right?” she enquired, tucking her hair behind an ear.
"
658,"i was not all right, and it was her damn fault. but when a young girl asks a guy if he is all
"
659,"right, he can never admit he is not.
"
660,"“yeah. i guess,” i said, flexing my palms.
"
661,"“can i give you a lift?” she asked nervously, extending a hand to help me up.
"
662,"i looked at her carefully as she came closer. maybe i was seeing a female after a long
"
663,"time or something, but i thought she was really pretty. and the whole just-out-of-the-bed
"
664,"look blew me. only girls can look hot in their nightclothes: alok, for instance, looks like a
"
665,"terminally ill patient in his torn vest and pajamas.
"
666,"“t was actually jogging,” i said, holding her hand and getting up as slowly as i could
"
667,"without being obvious. who wants to abandon a pretty girl’s hand? anyway, i had to after i
"
668,"was standing up.
"
669,"“hi. iam neha by the way. listen, i am really sorry,” she said, adjusting her hair again
"
670,"with the hand i had just held.
"
671,"“hi. iam hari, still alive so itis okay,” i grinned.
"
672,"“yeah, you see i am learning to drive,” she said pointing to the ‘l’ sign on the
"
673,"windscreen. that is understandable, i thought, you are allowed to hit people if you are
"
674,"learning to drive, especially if you are eye-candy.
"
675,"now to be very frank, i wasn’t hurt or anything. for one thing, she was driving at like two
"
676,"kilometers an hour, and i think my adipose tissues absorb bumps better than most people’s.
"
677,"still, i wanted to milk this moment.
"
678,"“you sure you don’t need a lift? i feel really bad,” she said, wringing her hands.
"
679,"“actually, iam sort of tempted to get a drop back to kumaon,” i said.
"
680,"“sure. please come in,” she said and chuckled, “if you trust my driving, that is.”
"
681,"we got into the car. i saw her sit carefully in the driver’s seat, as if she was running the
"
682,"starship enterprise or something. then she placed her bare foot on the accelerator. now
"
683,"maybe it is because i am an engineer, but that was hot. bare female skin on metal is
"
684,"enormously sexy. there was dark red nail polish on her toenails, with one or two toes
"
685,"encircled in weird squiggly silver ringlets that only girls can justify wearing. i just wanted
"
686,"to keep looking at her feet but she started to talk.
"
687,"“kumaon hostel, so a student, eh?”
"
688,"“yes. first year, mechanical engineering.”
"
689,"“cool. so how are you finding it, college and everything? fun?”
"
690,"“nothing much, just running around to keep up all the time.”
"
691,"“so you have to study a lot? what do guys call it — mugging.”
"
692,"“yeah, we have to mug. some damn profs get this vicious joy driving students nuts... .”
"
693,"“my dad 1s a prof,” neha said.
"
694,"“really?” i said and almost jumped in my seat. i was lucky i did not fully express my
"
695,"insightful views on professors and i was hoping she was not prof dubey’s daughter.
"
696,"“yes, i live in faculty housing,” she said. the car had passed the housing blocks now, and
"
697,"we were nearing the insti building.
"
698,"“and that is my dad’s office,” she said, pointing to one of the dozens of rooms.
"
699,"“really?” i said again, my mind racing flashback to gauge if i had done anything that
"
700,"could get me into trouble. “what’s his name?” i asked casually.
"
701,"“prof cherian. you probably don’t know him, he won’t take a course until your third
"
702,"year.”
"
703,"i shook my head. i had heard the name, but never seen prof cherian. then i remembered
"
704,"our first class. “is he the head of the mechanical engineering department?” i said, looking
"
705,"austerely away from her feet.
"
706,"sensing my anxiety, she patted my arm while shifting into third gear. “yes, he is. but don’t
"
707,"be tense, he is the prof, not me. so relax.” she burst out laughing as if she knew of my
"
708,"fascination with her feet.
"
709,"we chatted for a few more minutes along the insti-hostel road. she told me about her
"
710,"college, where she was studying fashion design. she had lived in this campus for over ten
"
711,"years and knew most of the professors.
"
712,"she apologized again when we came near kumaon, and asked if she could do anything for
"
713,"me.
"
714,"“no, it is all fine really,” i reassured her.
"
715,"“sure hari? so will i see you again when you jog?”
"
716,"“t guess,” i said, dreading another round of ryan’s training.
"
717,"“great. maybe sometime, i can drive you to the deer park outside campus, lots of joggers
"
718,"there. and you get excellent morning tea snacks there. i owe you a treat,” she said.
"
719,"i was nervous at meeting the daughter of my head of department again. but her offer, and
"
720,"mostly she herself, was too irresistible.
"
721,"“that sounds great,” i said leaping out of the car, “free food is always welcome. keep
"
722,"bumping me.”
"
723,"she smiled, waved and the little red car disappeared from sight. her image still floated
"
724,"in my head as i reached the kumaon lawns. ryan was already waiting there, doing push-ups
"
725,"or pull-downs or something. he had seen me get out of the car and demanded full
"
726,"explanation. i had to then repeat it to alok. though they exhibited appropriate excitement,
"
727,"asking me how she looked and everything, they also told me to stay away from her, given
"
728,"she was a prof ’s offspring.
"
729,"but they had neither seen her nor talked to her. i was dying to meet her again, was waiting
"
730,"for the next time i bumped into her and could feast silly at the sight of those two bare-naked
"
731,"feet!
"
732,"line drawing
"
733,"bang in the middle of the first semester came ryan’s scooter. his parents
"
734,"sent him a dollar cheque as a christmas gift as everybody else around them was doing in
"
735,"europe. ryan was not a christian and cared two hoots about christmas, but loved the
"
736,"cheque and cashed it; voila scooter — a beautiful kinetic honda in gleaming metallic blue.
"
737,"when ryan got it to kumaon, all the students gathered around it to pay homage, but only
"
738,"alok and i got to park our butts on it. it was for two people, but ryan carried both of us; we
"
739,"went to class, canteen and on rare occasions to movies like the 7erminator zipping away on
"
740,"ryan’s kinetic, letting the world watch us in envy and the scooter in probable pity, groaning
"
741,"as it was under our combined weight.
"
742,"meanwhile, classes got worse. the professors kept up the pressure and the overworked
"
743,"students worked even harder to beat the average, thereby pushing the average higher. we
"
744,"still studied together, but the resolve to concentrate was breaking down. we had managed to
"
745,"reach average grades in a few assignments, but 1n physics we had messed up.
"
746,"one night alok got a call from home. his father had had a seizure or something and
"
747,"someone had to take him to the hospital pronto. alok’s mother had never done this alone and
"
748,"she sounded hysterical enough to warrant a trip for herself to the hospital.
"
749,"there was a strong rumour of a physics quiz circulating but alok had no choice. ryan
"
750,"offered his scooter, which alok couldn’t drive for nuts. hence ryan had to go as well. i did
"
751,"not want to be alone, so i went along.
"
752,"it was the first time i’'d seen alok’s home. i told you he was kind of poor, i mean not
"
753,"world bank ads type starving poor or anything, but his home had the barest minimum one
"
754,"would need for existence. there was light, but no lampshades, there was a living room, but
"
755,"no couches, there was a tv, but not a colour one. the living room was where lived alok’s
"
756,"father, entertaining himself with one of the two tv channels, close to unconscious by the
"
757,"time we reached. alok’s mother was already waiting, using her sari edge to wipe her tears.
"
758,"“alok, my son, look what happens when you are not here,” she said in a pathetic voice
"
759,"that would make even hitler cry. man, i could totally see where alok got his whining talent.
"
760,"anyway, i hired an auto and ryan and alok lifted the patient into it. we then went to the
"
761,"hospital, checked him in and waited until a doctor, unfortunate enough to work in an
"
762,"overcrowded free government hospital, saw alok’s father. we returned to kumaon at three
"
763,"in the morning exhausted and nauseated by hospital smells.
"
764,"of course, you can imagine what happened the next day, the physics quiz, that’s what
"
765,"happened and we screwed up big time. we got like two on twenty or some such miserable
"
766,"score. alok tried to ask the professor for a re-quiz, who stared back as if he had been asked
"
767,"for both his kidneys.
"
768,"that physics quiz episode broke alok a bit. now he was less vigilant when ryan
"
769,"distracted us from studies.
"
770,"“you know guys, this whole iit system is sick,” ryan declared.
"
771,"“there he goes again,” i rolled my eyes. we were 1n my room.
"
772,"i expected alok to ignore ryan, but this time he led him on with a monosyllable. “why?”
"
773,"“because, tell me, how many great engineers or scientists have come out of iit?”
"
774,"“what do you mean? many ceos and entrepreneurs have,” i said, a mistake as ryan had
"
775,"not finished yet.
"
776,"“t mean this 1s supposed to be the best college in india, the best technology institute for a
"
777,"country of a billion. but has iit ever invented anything? or made any technical contribution
"
778,"to india?”
"
779,"“doesn’t it contribute 1n making engineers?” alok asked, snapping shut his book. i knew
"
780,"that with alok not keeping us in check, we were not going to study any more that day. i
"
781,"suggested we go out to sasi’s for paranthas and skip the mess dinner. everyone agreed.
"
782,"ryan continued to muse. “over thirty years of iits, yet, all it does 1s train some bright
"
783,"kids to work in multinationals. i mean look at mit in the usa.”
"
784,"“this 1s not the usa,” i said, signalling sasi’s minions to bring three plates of paranthas.
"
785,"“mits have budgets of millions of dollars.”
"
786,"“and anyway, who cares, i want to get the degree and land a good job,” alok said.
"
787,"sasi’s was a ramshackle, illegal roadside establishment right outside the iit hostel gates.
"
788,"using tents and stools, the alfresco dining menu included paranthas, lemonade and
"
789,"cigarettes. at two rupees each, the butter paranthas were a bargain, even by student
"
790,"standards. proprietor sasi knew the quality of food in the mess and did a voluminous
"
791,"business serving dozens of students each day from every hostel. we got three plates of
"
792,"paranthas, and the dollop of butter on top melted and produced a delicious aroma.
"
793,"“see, it is not always the money,” ryan said, flicking ash. “so iits cannot do space
"
794,"research, but we surely can make some cheaper products? and frankly, money is just an
"
795,"excuse. if there is value, the industry will pay for research even at iit.”
"
796,"“so what the hell 1s wrong then?” i was irritated. i seriously wanted ryan to shut up, now
"
797,"that the food was here. i mean, if he did not want to study, fine, but spare us the bloody
"
798,"lecture, it wreaks havoc on digestion.
"
799,"“what is wrong is the system,” ryan denounced soundly, sounding like a local politician.
"
800,"blame the whole damn system if you can’t figure anything out.
"
801,"but ryan had more. “this system of relative grading and overburdening the students. i
"
802,"mean it kills the best fun years of your life. but it kills something else. where is the room
"
803,"for original thought? where 1s the time for creativity? it is not fair.”
"
804,"“what about it is not fair? it gets me work, that’s all i care,” alok shrugged, taking a
"
805,"break from devouring his rations.
"
806,"“wow, that rhymes,” i said.
"
807,"“see your attitude is another problem. you won’t get it, forget it,” ryan said.
"
808,"“that rhymes too,” i said and alok and i broke into giggles. i knew i was annoying ryan
"
809,"like hell, but i really wanted him to shut up or at least change the topic. that lazy bastard
"
810,"would find any reason to goof off.
"
811,"“screw you,” ryan gestured, diving back to his plate.
"
812,"“anyway, i said, “so what 1s the plan for the weekend?”
"
813,"“nothing, why?” alok looked up.
"
814,"“well, we have the scooter now.”
"
815,"ryan stayed silent.
"
816,"“hey, stop sulking like a woman.” i nudged his elbow until he had to laugh.
"
817,"“yes, we can go, you dope. connaught place?”
"
818,"“why?” alok repeated.
"
819,"“well, they have this cheap dhabha there with the best butter chicken and we can catch a
"
820,"good hindi movie. and then maybe check out some girls in the market.” ryan’s eyes were
"
821,"exaggeratedly lecherous.
"
822,"“sounds good,” i said, the mention of girls making me think of neha. i had not bumped
"
823,"into her again, maybe i should go jogging again.
"
824,"“alok, youll come too, right? or will you mug all day?”
"
825,"“uh..there is this apmech worksheet... anyway, screw it man... yes, i will come,” alok
"
826,"capitulated.
"
827,"we did go to connaught place that weekend and had quite a blast. the movie was what
"
828,"every hindi movie is like — regular boy meets girl, boy is poor and honest, girl’s dad is rich
"
829,"and a crook. however, the heroine was new and eager to please the crowds so she bathed in
"
830,"the rain, played tennis in mini-skirts and wore sequined negligees to discos. since all her
"
831,"hobbies involved wearing less or transparent clothing, the audience loved her. the girl’s
"
832,"father damn near killed the boy who flirted with his hot daughter, but ultimately the hero’s
"
833,"love and lust prevailed. the hero had no damn assignments to finish and no freaky profs
"
834,"breathing down his neck. i know, these hindi movies are all crap, but they do kind of take
"
835,"your mind away from the crap of real life like nothing else.
"
836,"after movie came lunch. the dhabha was great as ryan is never wrong about these
"
837,"things. he ordered for everyone, which he always does. and he orders big — right from
"
838,"boneless butter chicken to daal to paranthas to raita. the spoilt brat even orders the
"
839,"overpriced coke, i mean, which student orders coke in restaurants? anyway, the meal was
"
840,"great, and an overactive desert-cooler sprayed water on our faces and kept the ambience
"
841,"cool.
"
842,"tearing his rotis like a famished unicef kid, alok got chatty. “this is too good man, the
"
843,"chicken is fundoo here.”
"
844,"“so tell me, fatso, did you have fun today or not?” ryan asked.
"
845,"“uh-huh,” said alok, mouth too stuffed with food, but he meant yes.
"
846,"“then tell me, why the hell do you want to kill yourself with books?”
"
847,"“aw, don’t you guys start arguing again,” i groaned. i had enjoyed my day so far and
"
848,"watching these jokers go at it 1s really not funny after a while.
"
849,"“we are not arguing,” ryan said, in a tone that sounded like he was arguing with me now.
"
850,"he took a deep breath. “okay, here is the thing. i have been thinking.”
"
851,"oh please, spare us, i thought. but it was too late.
"
852,"“guys, these are the best years of our life. they really are. i mean, especially for
"
853,"someone like alok.”
"
854,"“what, why specially me?” alok was baffled, nibbling at a chilli from the salad bowl.
"
855,"“tt brings out the amino acids in your eyes,” i joked, when he coughed at the tangy
"
856,"spiciness.
"
857,"“because,” ryan told alok, “look at your life before this. i mean, i know you love your
"
858,"dad and everything. but like, you were just nursing him and studying for the past two years.
"
859,"and after college, you’ll probably have to live with them again, right?”
"
860,"“pll take up a job in dell,” alok nodded, a bit more serious now, though his mind was
"
861,"still preoccupied with chicken breast.
"
862,"“exactly, so it is back to the same responsibility again. i mean, you will earn and
"
863,"everything, and maybe hire a servant. but still, would you be able to have this kind of fun?”
"
864,"“t love my parents, ryan, it is not a responsibility,” alok said and stopped eating. boy,
"
865,"this must have affected him. usually, the fatso will not leave chicken for his life.
"
866,"“of course, you love them,” ryan waved a hand. “i mean, i can understand that even
"
867,"though i don’t love my parents.”
"
868,"“what?” i said, though i had not wanted to be part of their argument.
"
869,"“t said i don’t love my parents. is that a big deal?”
"
870,"alok raised his eyebrows at me. i mean, if alok could love his dad, who if you think
"
871,"about it, 1s no more than a vegetable with vision, how could this brat not love his parents?
"
872,"and his parents were nice, i mean they gave him everything - the blue scooter, clothes from
"
873,"gap and money for the damn colas at restaurants. his parents had worked their asses off all
"
874,"their lives, started selling flower pots with two potters, and then moved all over india to
"
875,"make a name until two years ago when they went overseas. they weren’t making any big
"
876,"money out there yet but wanted to keep sonny boy happy, this spoilt, pigheaded, marginally
"
877,"good-looking ass who did not love them!
"
878,"“screw you,” i blessed.
"
879,"“screw you! you don’t even listen to me,” ryan said.
"
880,"yeah right, that when i listened to this idiot all the time.
"
881,"“why?” alok said, getting back to his food.
"
882,"“it don’t know why. i mean, i have been in boarding school when i was six. of course,
"
883,"like every kid i hated it and cried when they left me. but then, it was at boarding school i
"
884,"got everything. i did well in studies, got noticed in sports, learnt how to have fun and live
"
885,"well and made my best friends. so, somewhere down the line, i don’t miss them anymore.
"
886,"just kind of outgrew them. sure, we meet at vacation time and they send letters, cash, and
"
887,"everything but...”
"
888,"“but?”
"
889,"“but i don’t miss them.”
"
890,"“so you don’t think that is wrong?” alok picked teeth.
"
891,"“heck, no. i mean, for me my friends are everything, they are my family. mom and dad
"
892,"are nice, but i don’t love them the way i love my friends. i mean, i don’t love them, but i
"
893,"love my friends.”
"
894,"“so you /ove us then ryan aah? j jove you,” alok said in a falsetto; he was obviously
"
895,"satiated, his lighter mood a proof of his post-gluttony bonhomie.
"
896,"“up yours, fatso, love you my ass,” ryan said and some heads turned to look at us.
"
897,"ryan, however, came back to his earlier theory.
"
898,"“anyway, my point 1s, these are our best years. so either we can mug ourselves to death,
"
899,"or tell the system to stuff it.”
"
900,"“and how exactly do we tell the system to stuff it?” i enquired.
"
901,"“t mean, not like stop mugging completely or something, but like, let us draw a line. we
"
902,"can study two-three hours a day, but do other stuff, say sports, have you guys ever played
"
903,"squash? or taken part in events — debates, scrabble and stuff, an odd movie or something
"
904,"sometimes. we can do so much at the insti.”
"
905,"“yeah, but very few people do it. and they are the ones with pretty bad gpas,” alok
"
906,"said.
"
907,"“see, i am not saying we stop mugging. we just draw the line. a day of classes, then three
"
908,"hours a day of studies and the rest is our time. let’s just try, just one semester. isn’t it fair? a
"
909,"kind of decentralization of education.”
"
910,"alok and i looked at each other. ryan had a point. if i never played squash in college, ’'d
"
911,"probably never play it again. if i did not take part in scrabble now, i’d never do it when i
"
912,"had a job.
"
913,"“t can try,” i said, mostly to agree with ryan. he would not have stopped otherwise
"
914,"anyway.
"
915,"“three hours is not enough.” alok was doubtful.
"
916,"“okay, three and a half for our super-mugger,” ryan said, “okay?”
"
917,"alok agreed, but his voice was so meek, it sounded like the chicken he just ate speaking
"
918,"from within.
"
919,"ryan was elated, and he drove us back to kumaon at speeds that made the traffic police
"
920,"dizzy. no one stopped us, or rather, we didn’t stop. i covered the number plate with my foot,
"
921,"so that cops could not take it down. after all, this was a celebration of drawing the line.
"
922,"meanwhile, i ran into neha at the campus bookstore. i had not met her since she had tried to
"
923,"kill me and it wasn’t anyone’s fault. mostly that whole jogging plan was a bad idea. even
"
924,"with the prospect of meeting neha, i just could not wake up. i did try once again, but i was
"
925,"late and did not see her car. after that, all my motivation dropped and ryan gave up on
"
926,"waking me up. he had to, cause i kind of threatened to withdraw from his draw-the-line
"
927,"study plan. so, what i’m trying to say is, when i saw neha again, it was a nice surprise.
"
928,"”hi,” i said, raising my hand to catch her attention.
"
929,"she looked at me, and then kept looking, her face expressionless. she acted as if she did
"
930,"not recognize me. then she went back to flipping pages of the notebooks she had just
"
931,"bought. now that was hell, i mean, 1f you are in a public place and say ‘hi’ to a girl, all
"
932,"beaming and everything and she’s like ‘have we been introduced?’
"
933,"the shopkeeper looked at me, as did a few other customers, and i felt like low-life
"
934,"though i gave it another try. i mean, just a few weeks ago she was all sympathetic and
"
935,"friendly, so maybe she just couldn’t place me.
"
936,"“neha, it’s me! remember the car accident in the morning?” i said.
"
937,"“excuse me,” she said huffily and departed.
"
938,"this time the shopkeeper looked at me like i was a regular sex-offender. the girl bumped
"
939,"me and gave me a lift and all dammit, i wanted to scream, even as i bought my pencils and
"
940,"loose sheets. so i am not that attractive and that 1s reason enough not to recognize someone
"
941,"in public because i guess being friends with ugly people kind of rubs off badly on you. i had
"
942,"been some sort of a loser in school as well, so this was not a total shock. i mean what
"
943,"happened to me once in my school, i don’t even want to get into all that but somehow, i felt
"
944,"strange. i don’t know, neha did not look like that kind of girl.
"
945,"i walked out of the shop as quickly as possible to get away from the humiliation. i was
"
946,"feeling crap. i mean, she could have at least said “hi,” i thought. i know i am fat and if i
"
947,"were a girl, ’'d probably not talk to me either. i was walking alone on a narrow path
"
948,"connecting the bookshop to the hostel, when someone tapped my shoulder. i turned around
"
949,"and guess who?
"
950,"“hi,” said neha.
"
951,"go to hell, was my instant mental reflex. but i turned to look at her and damn, she was
"
952,"pretty. and with that one tiny dimple on her right cheek flashing every time she smiled...
"
953,"now tr y saying “go to hell’ to that!
"
954,"“hi. neha, right?” i said, this time really careful and slow.
"
955,"“of course. hey, i am really, really, really sorry, i could not reply to you properly there.
"
956,"there’s a reason,” she divulged.
"
957,"now, girls do this all the time, they think repeating an adjective makes it more effective;
"
958,"the three ‘reallys’ were supposed to constitute an apology.
"
959,"“what reason?” i said.
"
960,"“tt 1s just that, i mean... can we just forget it?”
"
961,"“no, tell me why?” i insisted.
"
962,"“the shopkeeper there knows me and my dad for the last ten years and they talk
"
963,"regularly.”
"
964,"“so?”
"
965,"“my dad is really strict about me talking to boys and he will totally flip out 1f he hears i
"
966,"am friends with a student.”
"
967,"“really? just greeting someone?”
"
968,"“he is like that. and campus rumours always get blown out of proportion. please, i am
"
969,"sorry.”
"
970,"she was being a bit ridiculous, i thought, but i kind of knew where she was coming from.
"
971,"some girls’ dads are a bit touchy, and with over a thousand boys with their proportional
"
972,"quota of hormones on campus he would be worried.
"
973,"“well, i can’t see you then anyway, right?”
"
974,"“you can as long as it is out of campus.”
"
975,"“we live here!”
"
976,"“yes, but there 1s a world outside. we can go to the hauz khas market. do you feel like
"
977,"some ice-cream?”
"
978,"it is hard enough to say no to pretty girls or to ice-cream but when it’s offered together, it
"
979,"is well nigh impossible. i said yes, and she instructed me to walk out the campus gate and
"
980,"walk two blocks to an ice-cream parlour. she would come there as well, but gave me a
"
981,"five-minute headstart, walking sedately behind me.
"
982,"it was completely weird to walk alone that way, and i kept thinking how stupid i'd look
"
983,"in the parlour if she did not show up. at least ’'d have ice-cream, i thought. food 1s almost
"
984,"as good as girls.
"
985,"but neha did show up and inside the cadbury’s ice-cream parlour she was a different
"
986,"person.
"
987,"“so, mr jogger, did not see much of you after that day. did i scare you off?” she began to
"
988,"giggle. girls do this all the time, say something half-funny, and laugh at it themselves.
"
989,"“no, it’s just a pain to wake up.”
"
990,"“well, i was kind of hoping to see you,” she confessed.
"
991,"“yeah, looked like it at the bookshop.”
"
992,"“t said i am sorry, hari,” she said, and touched my arm again like she had earlier. i kind
"
993,"of liked that, i mean, which guy wouldn’t. you have this pretty girl all smiley and sorry and
"
994,"touching your arm; better than ice-cream i tell you.
"
995,"there are two kinds of pretty girls in delhi. one is the modern type, girls who cut their
"
996,"hair short, wear jeans or skirts, and tiny earrings. the second is the traditional type who
"
997,"wears salwar-kameez, multi-coloured bindi and large earrings. neha was more the second
"
998,"type, and she wore a light-blue chikan suit with matching earrings. however, she was not a
"
999,"forced traditional type, like fat girls who have no choice but to wear indian clothes. neha
"
1000,"was just fine, and actually way out of my league, with her long light brown hair, which she
"
1001,"mostly left open, a curl catapulting carelessly on to her forehead. her face was completely
"
1002,"round, but not because she was fat or anything, just a natural cute shape. i just kept looking
"
1003,"at her as my strawberry ice-cream melted.
"
1004,"“friends?”
"
1005,"“t guess so. you know, when you ignored me there, i first thought it was because of the
"
1006,"way iam.”
"
1007,"“what way are you?”
"
1008,"“never mind,” i said.
"
1009,"i told neha about our harebrained scholastic plan.
"
1010,"“three hours? pretty brave i must say. guess you are underestimating the profs and their
"
1011,"love for assignments,” she said, scraping up whatever remained in her cup.
"
1012,"i shrugged my shoulders. “anyway, you tell me about yourself. learnt driving now?”
"
1013,"“yes, i even got a licence,” she chirped and opened her bag to show it to me. she started
"
1014,"taking stuff out of her handbag and a million things came out — lipsticks, lip balms, creams,
"
1015,"bindis, earrings, pens, mirrors, wet tissues and other stuff that one can live without. she
"
1016,"found what she was looking for eventually.
"
1017,"“wow. neha samir cherian, female, 18 years,” i read her name aloud.
"
1018,"“hey, stop it. you are not supposed to notice ladies’ ages.”
"
1019,"“that is for sixty-year-old women, you are young.” i returned her licence.
"
1020,"“still, i like chivalrous men,” she said, repacking her bag and the million belongings.
"
1021,"i did not know if it meant something. i mean, did she want me to know what kind of men
"
1022,"she liked, or did she want me to be like the men she liked, or did she like me. who knows?
"
1023,"figuring out women is harder than topping a manpro quiz.
"
1024,"“samir, isn’t that a guy’s name?”
"
1025,"“tt 1s my brother’s. i decided to keep it when i got this licence made.”
"
1026,"“really? what does your brother do?”
"
1027,"“not much,” she shrugged. “he’s dead.”
"
1028,"now this was unexpected. i mean, i just thought i'd tease her on a mannish middle name
"
1029,"and everything but this was turning heavy. “oh!” i said.
"
1030,"“tt’s fine, really, he died one year ago. we were just two years apart, so you can imagine
"
1031,"how close i was to him.”
"
1032,"i nodded my head. her beautiful face was turning sad and i wished i could do something
"
1033,"clownish to change subjects.
"
1034,"“how did it happen?” i asked, for it seemed the polite thing to do.
"
1035,"“a freak accident. he was crossing the rail-tracks and got hit by a train.”
"
1036,"i wondered if i could take a chance and hold her arm like she had a few minutes ago. i
"
1037,"mean, that 1s how shallow i was. she was all choked up and everything, but all i could think
"
1038,"of was if i could make my move.
"
1039,"i shifted my hand closer, but she startled me by talking again. “life goes on, you know. he
"
1040,"was my only sibling, so that is kind of tough. but life goes on,” she repeated, more to herself
"
1041,"than to me.
"
1042,"i pulled my hand back. i sensed this was not the best moment.
"
1043,"“ice-cream? c’mon let us do round two,” she said brightly and went up to the counter
"
1044,"without waiting for me. she returned with these two big sundaes, and she was smiling again.
"
1045,"“so he had a train accident? in delhi?”
"
1046,"“yes. you don’t think that can happen?” she asked challengingly.
"
1047,"“no... .0.”
"
1048,"“c’ mon, tell me something cheerful about your hostel.”
"
1049,"i told her about ryan’s scooter and how we over-speed on it and things. it was hardly
"
1050,"interesting, but it changed the topic. we talked about other things until dusk and neha’s
"
1051,"internal clock went off.
"
1052,"“have to go,” she jumped up. “shall we walk back?”
"
1053,"“yeah. separately though right?” i was catching on fast.
"
1054,"“yes, sorry please,” she said in a mock-baby tone that girls lapse into at the slightest
"
1055,"provocation.
"
1056,"i stood up, too.
"
1057,"“so, hari?”
"
1058,"“so what?”
"
1059,"“aren’t you going to ask me out or what?”
"
1060,"that stumped me. i mean, of course i'd wanted to but thought she’d say no for sure and
"
1061,"then i'd have felt crap all mght. i would have been satisfied with the ice-cream and
"
1062,"everything but this was kind of neat, and now i had no choice anyway.
"
1063,"“huh? sure. neha, would you like to go out... with me?”
"
1064,"she had made it pretty safe for me, but i tell you, the first time you ask a girl for a date, it
"
1065,"is like the hardest thing. almost as stressful as vivas.
"
1066,"“yes, of course i will. meet me at this parlour next saturday, same time as today.”
"
1067,"i nodded.
"
1068,"“and next time, don’t be this shy iit boy, just ask.”
"
1069,"i smiled.
"
1070,"“so, what are you waiting for? leave now.”
"
1071,"a demure five minutes ahead of her, i pleasantly dwelt on the mechanics of the female
"
1072,"mind, waddling back into hostel.
"
1073,"make notes not war
"
1074,"u.s. was gunning for iraq, taking as its first casualty our majors, or
"
1075,"end-semester exams. thousands of kilometres from our campus, a despotic dictator annexed
"
1076,"another smaller despotic dictator’s country. it just so happened that both countries had heaps
"
1077,"of oil and that made the whole world take notice. next, the world’s most powerful country
"
1078,"asked the dictator to get the hell out. big dictator refused and very soon it became clear that
"
1079,"he would be attacked.
"
1080,"so, what the hell did this have to do with the three of us at itt, you’d think. if this was one
"
1081,"of ryan’s stupid sci-fi movies, the three of us could be like involved in a conspiracy, using
"
1082,"the iit lab to provide superior weapons to the cia or something. but this was not sci-fi, and
"
1083,"the three of us considered ourselves lucky to complete the manpro welding assignment on
"
1084,"time, let alone provide superior war technology.
"
1085,"no, the gulf war did not personally invite our involvement but it was a big bang that
"
1086,"swallowed our first semester majors, a catalyst for all our competitive, macho instincts.
"
1087,"but before that let me tell you of the glory days of the short-lived ‘draw-the-line’ policy.
"
1088,"as per plan we studied for three exact hours every day, mostly late unto night, which meant
"
1089,"we had the evenings free for fun.
"
1090,"“the best game ever invented,” ryan said as he took us to the squash courts despite alok
"
1091,"and me looking like guys who never came near a mile of a squash court.
"
1092,"“this game will rest your mind, and burn some of that fat off.” ryan, who had been the
"
1093,"squash captain in his school, tossed warm-up shots in the court.
"
1094,"unless you are like a champion or something, you probably know how difficult the damn
"
1095,"game is. the rubber ball jumps around like a frog high on uppers, and you jump around it to
"
1096,"try and connect it to your racket. ryan had played it for years and alok and i were hopeless
"
1097,"at it. i missed connecting the ball to the racket five times in a row, and alok did not even try
"
1098,"moving from his place. after a while, even i gave up. ryan tried to keep the game going as
"
1099,"we stood like extra pillars on court.
"
1100,"“c’mon guys, try at least,” ryan called out.
"
1101,"“t can’t do this,” alok said and sat down on the court. the guy is such a loser. i mean, i
"
1102,"could not play squash for nuts, but at least i won’t sit down on the court.
"
1103,"“let us try again tomorrow,” ryan said, optimistic to say the least.
"
1104,"he dragged us to court for ten days in a row, but alok and i got no better. we found it
"
1105,"hard enough to even spot where the ball had gone, let alone chase it.
"
1106,"“ryan, we can’t do this man,” alok said plaintively, panting uncontrollably. “if you really
"
1107,"want to play this, why don’t you find other partners?”
"
1108,"“why? you guys are getting better,” ryan said.
"
1109,"yeah right, maybe in thirty years, i thought grimly.
"
1110,"“so you don’t enjoy this?”
"
1111,"what was ryan thinking? enjoy? enjoy? i was in danger of tearing that ball into roughly
"
1112,"fifty pieces.
"
1113,"“not really,” i ventured mildly.
"
1114,"“fine then, we don’t have to do this. i mean, i can give up squash,” ryan said.
"
1115,"“no, that is not...” alok said.
"
1116,"ryan had already decided, no point arguing with him. it was his whole ‘where my friends
"
1117,"go, i go’ stand, though i kind of felt bad making him give up his favourite sport.
"
1118,"“you can play with others,” i suggested.
"
1119,"“others aren’t my friends,” ryan said in a firm voice that sounded like the final word.
"
1120,"alok and i shrugged and we left the court.
"
1121,"after squash came something tamer and less active, chess. alok and i felt somewhat up to
"
1122,"this one, for, unlike squash, we could at least touch and move the game pieces. but ryan
"
1123,"usually won, and i would never be passionate about bumping off plastic pieces like him.
"
1124,"apart from chess, we spent our free time riding ryan’s scooter, feeling the fierce wind
"
1125,"whistle through our hair. we caught every new movie, visited every tourist destination in
"
1126,"delhi, did everything, went everywhere.
"
1127,"for the most part, we managed fine within the three hours assigned to studies. sometimes
"
1128,"assignments took longer, leaving no time for revision. that worried alok, especially when
"
1129,"the end-semester exams edged closer, and he suggested increasing the limit. and we would
"
1130,"have if it hadn’t been for one thing — the afore-mentioned gulf war.
"
1131,"now wars happen all the time and india alone has fought more than it can afford. but the
"
1132,"gulf war was different, as it came right on tv cnn, an american news channel, had just
"
1133,"opened shop in india and brought the deserts of iraq right into our tv room.
"
1134,"“this is cnn reporting live from the streets of baghdad. the sky 1s lit up with the first
"
1135,"air raid,” a well-groomed person told us.
"
1136,"alok, ryan and i looked up from our chess game. it was sensational, spectacular and
"
1137,"unlike anything we had ever seen on tv. to put it in context, this was before cable or any
"
1138,"private channels came to india. until then we had two crummy government channels in
"
1139,"which women played obsolete instruments and dull men read news for insomniacs and
"
1140,"retards. colour had only arrived two years ago, and most programs were still black and
"
1141,"white. then, in one quick week, we had the glitzy, jazzy and live — cnn.
"
1142,"“ts this real? i mean is this happening?” alok looked dazed.
"
1143,"“of course, fatso. you think this is a play?” ryan scoffed as two american pilots hi-
"
1144,"fived themselves after hours of pounding a perfectly real city. a cnn reporter asked them
"
1145,"questions about their mission. the soldiers told about bombing a godown, and taking down
"
1146,"a power station that gave electricity to baghdad.
"
1147,"“wow, the americans are going to win this,” alok said.
"
1148,"“don’t underestimate the iraqis, who have fought wars for ten years. americans are just
"
1149,"pounding from the air,” ryan said.
"
1150,"“yes, but america is too powerful. saddam hasn’t a clue.”
"
1151,"“he does, wait till a land battle happens,” ryan defended.
"
1152,"the war sucked us in like quicksand, alok and ryan got really into ‘who 1s going to win
"
1153,"this’ kind of crap. i mean, you stop doing that when you are twelve i think (superman or
"
1154,"batman?), but there was no stopping them. i liked watching the war as well, though i primly
"
1155,"took no sides.
"
1156,"iraq was kind of anonymous then, and we unabashedly cheered on america. iit cared
"
1157,"about america. most of our foreign aid came from rich american firms and quite a large
"
1158,"percentage of our alumni went on scholarship there and for jobs, constituting a chunk of the
"
1159,"brain drain. so, unsurprisingly, our heart bled for the us.
"
1160,"at the same time, the war visuals became more gruesome. americans pounded baghdad
"
1161,"non-stop, and saddam hid himself deep in one of his oil wells i think. many times,
"
1162,"americans hit civilian targets and people died and everything, and that was crap. i mean,
"
1163,"the aid to iit was fine, but how can you justify bombing kids? but then, saddam was kind of
"
1164,"this loser general anyway, and apparently shot his own people when he was grumpy. oh, it
"
1165,"was impossible to take sides in the gulf war. and it was all pointless for us anyway. these
"
1166,"guys would realize this soon.
"
1167,"“man, the majors are eight days away,” alok finally said one day. “we’ve got to switch
"
1168,"off the tv.”
"
1169,"“we still study three hours though.” ryan quirked an eyebrow.
"
1170,"“screw three hours! it’s not enough,” i contributed.
"
1171,"“t think iraq will win,” ryan said.
"
1172,"“drop it, man, america has busted him,” alok said, “so please i beg you ryan, let’s study
"
1173,"before we’re busted too.”
"
1174,"“not yet, ground battle not done yet,” he said righteously.
"
1175,"luckily, the war ended five days before the majors. america won big-time, and iraqis ate
"
1176,"crow before ground battle. saddam left kuwait alone and americans were happy all the oil
"
1177,"in the world was theirs to burn and ryan did not eat for a day or so.
"
1178,"“this is not fair. real wars are fought on the ground,” he wailed as we started revisions
"
1179,"for the final tests in our room.
"
1180,"“shut up, ryan. americans got what they wanted. now can we study?” i said.
"
1181,"“unfair man. us is a schoolroom bully.”
"
1182,"“apmech, apmech” alok muttered like a mantra.
"
1183,"squash, chess and the war — all ate into our studying hours. in the five days before exams,
"
1184,"we dropped the three-hour rule, well we had to; the heaps of course material was un-doable
"
1185,"even if we studied thirty hours a day. it was important to clamp down on ryan and we
"
1186,"studied until three 1n the morning ever y day and passionately prayed india would go to war
"
1187,"on the morning of our first majors.
"
1188,"a day before the majors were practical tests. it was the only part of the course ryan
"
1189,"enjoyed, and he dragged us early to the physics lab. we were in the same group and had to
"
1190,"conduct an electrical setup and then answer questions in a viva-voce. we got a resistance-
"
1191,"voltage relationship testing experiment.
"
1192,"i hated practical tests. most of all, i dreaded the viva-voce. i don’t know if i told you
"
1193,"about my condition; it strikes me whenever someone looks me in the eye and asks me a
"
1194,"question. my body freezes, sweat beads cover me brow to groin, and i lose my sense of
"
1195,"voice. how i hated vivas and when ryan was all excited assembling the circuit for the
"
1196,"experiment, i hated him too.
"
1197,"“hey guys, watch this,” ryan said, holding the circuit components in his hand.
"
1198,"alok looked up from his notebook.
"
1199,"ryan spent the next ten minutes connecting resistors, capacitors, switches and cables to
"
1200,"each other. it was completely unconnected to our experiment and alok was seriously getting
"
1201,"worried.
"
1202,"“ryan, can you please connect the resistor-voltage setup so we can start our experiment?”
"
1203,"alok said.
"
1204,"“wait fatso, we have two hours to do the experiment. do they have a small speaker
"
1205,"here?” ryan fumbled through the component box.
"
1206,"“what do you need a speaker for?” i said even as ryan found one and made the final
"
1207,"connection.
"
1208,"“for this,” ryan said and switched his circuit on. he moved a few connections, and soon
"
1209,"hindi music came from the speaker.
"
1210,"“ghar aaya mera pardesi...”
"
1211,"“what the hell!’ alok jumped as if a ghost had shimmered into the lab.
"
1212,"“tt is a radio, stupid,” ryan said, eyes all lit up, “i knew we had all the parts to make
"
1213,"one.”
"
1214,"“ryan,” i said, as firmly as possible.
"
1215,"“what?”
"
1216,"“we are having a damn major here,” i said.
"
1217,"that is ryan. the guy will do clever things but only at the wrong time and wrong place.
"
1218,"alok panicked, too. “the viva 1s in twenty minutes, boss.”
"
1219,"ryan ripped off his circuit and looked at us in disdain as 1f we were tone-deaf listeners
"
1220,"who had rejected live mozart.
"
1221,"we just about managed to finish the circuit on time when prof goyal walked in.
"
1222,"“hmm...,” the prof said tugging at the circuit wires. ryan had made the circuit; he was
"
1223,"good at this, we trusted him.
"
1224,"“so, ryan what will happen if i change the 100-ohm resistor with a 500-ohm resistor?”
"
1225,"“sir, we would have higher voltage across, though there would be a higher heat loss as
"
1226,"well.”
"
1227,"“hmm...” prof goyal scratched his chin in response, which meant ryan was right.
"
1228,"“so alok, how do you read the stripes on this resistor to get the ohm resistance?”
"
1229,"“sur, the red stripe 1s a 100-ohm, then 10 for the blue, implying 110 ohm.”
"
1230,"our group was doing well. but prof goyal was not done. despite my frantic hopes, he
"
1231,"turned to me.
"
1232,"“so hari, 1f i add another resistor on top of the 110 ohm resistor, what happens to the
"
1233,"current flow?”
"
1234,"a trick question. the current flow depends on how one connects the new resistor, in
"
1235,"series or parallel. in series, the current would drop. in parallel, it would increase. yes, this
"
1236,"was the answer. i think so, right?
"
1237,"i had recited the answer in my mind. but prof goyal stared at me and me alone while
"
1238,"asking the question, not surprising since he prefixed the question with what was a good
"
1239,"facsimile of my name.
"
1240,"“sir...” i quivered as my hand started to shiver. my condition was upon me.
"
1241,"“what will happen to the current flow?”
"
1242,"“sir..l... sir,” i said, inexorably tumbling toward total paralysis. i mean, i totally knew the
"
1243,"answer but what if it was wrong? i tried articulating, but the thoughts did not cash into
"
1244,"words.
"
1245,"“sir, the current flow depen...” ryan intervened, trying to save the situation.
"
1246,"prof goyal raised his forefinger.
"
1247,"“quiet, i am asking your group member, not you.”
"
1248,"i shook my head and lowered it. there was no use, i had given up.
"
1249,"“hmm...” prof goyal said, not scratching any part of his face. “the standard of this
"
1250,"institute is going down day by day. what are you, commerce students?”
"
1251,"calling an iit-1an a commerce student was one of the worst insults the profs could accord
"
1252,"to us, like a prostitute calling her client a eunuch. the institute was the temple of science
"
1253,"and anyone below standards was an outcaste or a commerce student.
"
1254,"prof goyal scribbled a c+ on our group experiment sheet, and tossed it at us. ryan caught
"
1255,"it, i think.
"
1256,"we did not have much of a chance to discuss the physics practicals, as the majors started
"
1257,"the next day. i had even postponed my next rendezvous with neha until after the exams. i had
"
1258,"called her once, getting her number from the faculty’s internal directory. she freaked out,
"
1259,"telling me not to call home without notice. how the hell was i supposed to give her notice?
"
1260,"anyway, we had fixed to meet the day after my majors.
"
1261,"majors were when everyone studied in kumaon, lights remained on in rooms until dawn,
"
1262,"people rarely spoke — and then only on matters of life or death — and consumed endless cups
"
1263,"of tea in the all-night mess. ryan, alok and i scrambled to revise our six courses. the
"
1264,"exams schedule was three continuous days, leaving little time to discuss the tests. i knew i
"
1265,"had done fine in some tests and screwed up some. alok had developed a permanent scowl
"
1266,"and ryan could maintain his laid-back air only with the utmost effort; no jokes, majors blow
"
1267,"the wind out of anyone. manpro, apmech, physics, mathematics, chemistry and computing.
"
1268,"one by one, we finished them. when majors ended, it did seem like the worst was over
"
1269,"though the results come only after two weeks.
"
1270,"those two weeks between the end of majors and the results were bliss. even though the
"
1271,"second semester began, no one really got into the new courses until they knew how they’d
"
1272,"done in the first semester. the profs were busy evaluating tests, going easy on new
"
1273,"assignments, giving us plenty of time to kill. ryan upgraded us from chess to crossword
"
1274,"puzzles, taking us from cryptic clues to rhyme words to anagrams.
"
1275,"meanwhile, i met neha again on a summery evening early into the second semester even
"
1276,"though she had short-circuited when i called her. it was the same ice-cream parlour.
"
1277,"“god, are you crazy or what, calling at home?” she greeted.
"
1278,"i didn’t know what to say. i thought i’d been pretty cool to think of getting the number
"
1279,"from the profs directory and everything.
"
1280,"“how else am i to reach you?
"
1281,"“my parents are very strict about me getting calls from boys.”
"
1282,"i couldn’t tell her, “your parents sound like regular psychos,” so in non-sequitur, i asked,
"
1283,"“strawberry?”
"
1284,"she was wearing a demure white salwar-kameez that day. she held my hand as she took
"
1285,"the cone from me. god, she is beautiful, i tell you.
"
1286,"“so how am i supposed to reach you?”
"
1287,"“call me on the 11th.”
"
1288,"a pink tongue darting out to catch some melted cream from reaching the ground had
"
1289,"disoriented me. “huh?”
"
1290,"“just call me on the 11th of any month.”
"
1291,"now neha 1s beautiful and everything, but she can be pretty loony at times.
"
1292,"“what? why 119”
"
1293,"“because no one is at home that day. you see, my brother died on 11™ may. so on every
"
1294,"11"" my parents go to this temple near the rail-tracks where he died. they are gone most of
"
1295,"the day.”
"
1296,"“really? and you don’t go?”
"
1297,"“t used to. but it used to remind me of samir a lot. ’'d be depressed for days afterward
"
1298,"and the doctor told me not to go.”
"
1299,"she said it matter of factly, as if she were choosing an ice-cream flavour. it was strange,
"
1300,"but a hell of a lot better than her gearing up to cry or something; i can’t stand people who
"
1301,"cry 1n public.
"
1302,"“only on 119”
"
1303,"“well for now, that is the only safe date,” she said and laughed, “why? you want to talk
"
1304,"more often?”
"
1305,"i did not answer her. i mean, i just thought it weird that i could call her only on that one
"
1306,"day a month, like i had a dental appointment or something. but girls are weird, i was
"
1307,"learning.
"
1308,"“so tell me,” she said tapping my hand again to change the topic, “how were the majors?”
"
1309,"i loved it when she touched me in any way, that’s how deprived or depraved i was; i
"
1310,"almost forgot her question in the aftermath of the tiny localized tremors exploding on my
"
1311,"skin’s surface.
"
1312,"“uh majors... nothing great. results come in one week or so.”
"
1313,"“did well?”
"
1314,"“not really.”
"
1315,"“you want me to put in a word to dad to increase your grades?” she said.
"
1316,"“can you?” the pinkness enveloped me.
"
1317,"“tm kidding,”
"
1318,"of course. she giggled as if she had got me. like i thought i believed she could help me
"
1319,"with my grades or something. girls love laughing at their own jokes but neha amused 1s
"
1320,"better than neha looking around furtively.
"
1321,"i suddenly leaned forward, bringing my face close to hers. catching her breath, stifling
"
1322,"that laugh and pink tongue, she watched me wide-eyed. i removed the wallet from my back
"
1323,"pocket and sat down casually again.
"
1324,"“what happened?” i asked idly.
"
1325,"“t thought... never mind.” she blinked.
"
1326,"ha, gotcha.
"
1327,"five-point something
"
1328,"“they’re out!” alok said, shaking ryan’s shoulder on a saturday morning
"
1329,"as if india had won the world cup or nude women were rolling on the grass outside. “the
"
1330,"major results are out!”
"
1331,"“t want to sleep,” ryan said, burrowing deeper under the quilt that alok eventually
"
1332,"succeeded in tugging off.
"
1333,"we reached the insti where a crowd of students had gathered to see their first set of
"
1334,"grades. from these one could determine their first grade point average, or gpa, on the
"
1335,"10point scale. the topper would be close to 10.00, while the average would be around
"
1336,"6.50. we, however, were closer to the bottom. clicking through the scientific calculator,
"
1337,"alok calculated our scores.
"
1338,"“ok, hari 1s at 5.46 and... ryan is at 5.01 andi... ?mat 5.88,” alok said.
"
1339,"“so all of us are five-pointers,” i said, as if making a particulary insightful comment.
"
1340,"“congrats alok, you have topped amongst us,” ryan said.
"
1341,"topped amongst us, i thought. as if we were the high-brain society or something. these
"
1342,"were pathetic grades: we ranked in the high 200s in a class of 300 students. alok
"
1343,"recalculated his score, hoping for some miracle to happen on the calculator. but miracles
"
1344,"never happen in iit, only crap grades do.
"
1345,"“screw that. bloody hell, i am just a 5.88. this is so below average.”
"
1346,"“we knew that, right?” ryan said, “whatever. alok, let’s celebrate this over chicken.”
"
1347,"“celebrate!” alok spluttered. “i have just screwed up any chance of getting a us
"
1348,"scholarship or a good job and you want to bloody celebrate?”
"
1349,"“grow up, fatso. what do you want to do? mug more in mourning?” ryan was calm.
"
1350,"“fuck you,” alok said.
"
1351,"it was the first time he had used the ‘f’ word. from him, it sounded peculiar, i mean he is
"
1352,"still a kid.
"
1353,"ryan’s calmness vanished faster than a prof ’s smile. “what did you say?” he turned
"
1354,"toward me, “what did the fatso say?”
"
1355,"why was the bastard dragging me into this? ryan had damn well heard what alok said. in
"
1356,"fact, all the twittering students around us had heard it too.
"
1357,"“c’mon guys, let’s take the show to the hostel,” i pleaded. i don’t care if they kill each
"
1358,"other, but privacy i insist on. they were in no mood to let go and for a moment i thought they
"
1359,"were going to ignore me and have a fisticuff right there. somehow, i knew this wasn’t one of
"
1360,"the regular ryan-alok arguments; this had, at its core, their basic character contrasts.
"
1361,"“let’s go,” i said again and they dragged their feet back to the scooter. ryan rode us back
"
1362,"to the hostel as rashly as he possibly could, intentionally going over ever y bump on the
"
1363,"road. he has his own strange way of sulking i tell you.
"
1364,"we sat in ryan’s room after dinner, we had not spoken a word since the insti. i had thought a
"
1365,"little about my little gpa. yes, a five-pointer was pretty crap. from now on, every prof
"
1366,"would know that i was a below average student and that would influence my grade in future
"
1367,"courses. i knew a few five-pointers who were panned at campus recruitment last year. this
"
1368,"was crap, how did i get into this situation? was i just not smart enough? at the dinner table,
"
1369,"other students were either plain morose or extremely excited. there was the studious
"
1370,"venkat, who never left his room and was always quiet at meals. today, he was smiling. he
"
1371,"had a nine point five. he sat next to alok, and told his stories of topping in four out of six
"
1372,"courses. alok was talking only to him and totally ignoring us. there were others too. even
"
1373,"the smiling surd in our wing had managed a respectable seven point three. i think the three
"
1374,"of us were the lowest in kumaon or something. i could have mulled more over my future, or
"
1375,"rather the lack of it, but ryan and alok’s swollen faces filled my immediate vision.
"
1376,"we trooped into ryan’s room and sat quietly for half an hour or so. nobody opened a
"
1377,"book, looked at each other or said a word. i wondered if we were going to stay quiet
"
1378,"forever. i mean, that couldn’t be such a bad thing. we could attend class, study together and
"
1379,"eat together, quiet as mice. maybe our grades would improve as well. it really isn’t that
"
1380,"important for people to talk.
"
1381,"but my rosy fantasy of silence was finally broken by ryan.
"
1382,"“so, you are not going to apologize?” he asked belligerently.
"
1383,"“apologize? me? it is you who should apologize ryan,” alok said.
"
1384,"“you are the one who said “fuck you’ in front of the whole damn insti,” ryan said, “and i
"
1385,"should apologize? hari, can you believe this? / should apologize.”
"
1386,"now this had nothing to do with me, so i ignored ryan. let the two nuts figure it out
"
1387,"amongst themselves.
"
1388,"“you just don’t fucking get it do you?” alok said, going the ‘damn’ way with ‘fuck’.
"
1389,"ryan kept silent.
"
1390,"“get what?” i said. i mean, i really wanted to know what i was missing in this moronic
"
1391,"conversation.
"
1392,"“get this. today i got a gpa of 5.88. damn it, a 5.88. over 200 students have done better.
"
1393,"do you know in my twelve years in school i never even got a second rank.”
"
1394,"in most parts of the world, that would be a pretty loser statement to make. to announce
"
1395,"that you were like this nerd 1n school 1s hardly something to be proud of. but that is alok for
"
1396,"you.
"
1397,"“so?” ryan said, “your insti grades are bad. and who cares about how much you
"
1398,"mugged. why the hell should / apologize?”
"
1399,"“because damn it... because it 1s your damn fault,” alok said and stood up.
"
1400,"now that was whacko. poor ryan had just managed to scrape a five, and now he was
"
1401,"getting crap from alok.
"
1402,"“my fault?” ryan said and started laughing. “hari, listen to this. fatso screws up his
"
1403,"grades and it is ryan’s fault. my fault. hey alok, have you gone nuts or something?”
"
1404,"“say something,” alok beseeched me.
"
1405,"“say what?’ i looked away from both of them.
"
1406,"“tt 1s okay. if hari does not have the guts to say it, i can. you and your ideas, ryan. study
"
1407,"less, draw the line, enjoy the best years, this system is a machine, crap, crap and more crap
"
1408,"all the time.”
"
1409,"ryan stood up from his chair as well; i think it gives you an edge in the argument if you
"
1410,"stand up, kind of more serious and purposeful.
"
1411,"“t know you are upset and everything but there is no need to overreact. just some stupid
"
1412,"grades...”
"
1413,"“t am not overreacting,” alok said and sat back down. “and it is not just stupid grades
"
1414,"for me. i don’t have my parents earning dollars like yours. i came to this institute with a
"
1415,"purpose. to do well, get a good job and look after my parents. and you have fucked it up.”
"
1416,"another f-word; alok was still upset i guess.
"
1417,"“stop saying fuck all the time,” ryan said.
"
1418,"“t will say whatever i want. that is the problem. no one can say anything to you. you
"
1419,"propose something, hari blindly agrees and we all end up doing it. you are just a spoilt
"
1420,"brat. someone who wants to do whatever he wants without caring for his friends.”
"
1421,"“what? what did you just say? that i don’t care for my friends?” ryan said. though his
"
1422,"voice was notched at a menacing pitch, i noticed his hands starting to shiver a little bit.
"
1423,"“no. you don’t care about anything — not studies, not the insti, not your parents and not
"
1424,"your friends. you just want to have your fun.”
"
1425,"“you're crossing the line here,” ryan warned.
"
1426,"“t am drawing the line for a change. from now on, i am not going to hang out with you
"
1427,"anymore, it is official.”
"
1428,"now it was pretty clear that alok was overreacting. “what are you saying, man?” i said.
"
1429,"“no drop-shrop it. i have listened to you guys for the entire first semester and screwed up
"
1430,"everything,” alok said.
"
1431,"“so what are you going to do?”
"
1432,"“like i said, no more hanging out with ryan. from now on, i am going to be with venkat.
"
1433,"he has agreed to let me study with him. he got a nine point five you know?”
"
1434,"i felt disgusted. nobody 1n kumaon talked to venkat; given a choice he wouldn’t talk to
"
1435,"himself. he had a good gpa and everything, but he was hardly human. venkat woke up at
"
1436,"four in the morning to squeeze in four hours of muggins before classes. every evening he
"
1437,"spent three hours in the library before dinner. then after dinner, he studied on his bed for
"
1438,"another couple of hours until he went to sleep. who on earth would want to be with him?
"
1439,"“you are sick alok,” ryan said, “you are just one sick person.”
"
1440,"“my grades are important to me. my future is important to me. does that make me sick?”
"
1441,"i went to alok and put my arm around his shoulder; kind of felt he needed comfort during
"
1442,"insanity. “c’mon alok, we can study more...”
"
1443,"“stop c’mon-aloking me, will you?” alok pushed my arm away, voice all wobbly.
"
1444,"“enough 1s enough,” he said, his face contorted exactly like his mother’s.
"
1445,"this heredity factor fascinated me; was there a how-to-cry gene? or was this something
"
1446,"he had picked up while growing up? maybe alok’s family all cried together sometimes;
"
1447,"mother, sister and himself bawling away with his father, who could still produce tears from
"
1448,"one eye.
"
1449,"“you don’t understand that i have responsibilities. i have to do well to support my family.
"
1450,"half my mother’s salary goes for my father’s medicine. she has not bought a new sari for
"
1451,"herself in five years,” alok said as he choked on his tears. he needed to blow his nose.
"
1452,"ryan sat down to watch alok, intrigued. he could take “fuck yous’ ten a minute, but
"
1453,"crying was a different game altogether. and the whole one-saree-in-five-years was tough to
"
1454,"argue against. i mean, how do you argue with that? how many sarees a year is reasonable? i
"
1455,"don’t know, and ryan for sure had no damn clue.
"
1456,"“and my sister needs to be married,” alok went on, “everyone 1s counting on me. and
"
1457,"you guys don’t understand. ryan wants to play chess, see tv, enjoy his years. i hate
"
1458,"enjoyment.”
"
1459,"“will it make it better if i say sorry? i mean, you aren’t making any sense. and this whole
"
1460,"parents deal — you know i don’t understand that.” ryan was gentling, i could see.
"
1461,"but this shifted alok into higher gear. “of course, you don’t. how could you? you never
"
1462,"had them.”
"
1463,"“t had them. i mean i still have them. but i don’t sit and cry for them.”
"
1464,"“because you don’t love them.”
"
1465,"“yes i don’t. but at least iam not crying like a baby.”
"
1466,"“shut up!” alok screamed and continued crying.
"
1467,"“you are a baby. a sissy-fat baby. sorry sissy baby, now wipe your nose,” ryan said and
"
1468,"started laughing. it is something he always does when he can’t think of anything else, a kind
"
1469,"of conversation filler.
"
1470,"“shut up you... you...” alok said.
"
1471,"“t want my mummeeeeee,” ryan said, imitating alok’s choked tones.
"
1472,"“*.. shut up, you abandoned orphan!”
"
1473,"silence. yes, sometimes people say something so messed up that all bets go off. ryan’s
"
1474,"laughter vanished 1n a nanosecond. i sat up straight, confused if ’'d heard right. even alok
"
1475,"noticed the change 1n expressions and froze. twenty solid, slow and long seconds of silence
"
1476,"followed.
"
1477,"“orphan. hari, he called me an orphan,” ryan said.
"
1478,"i stayed silent. alok stayed silent.
"
1479,"“just get out. go to venkat or whichever prick you want to be with. just get lost,” ryan
"
1480,"said.
"
1481,"“t don’t need you to tell me. hari?” alok said, not crying anymore.
"
1482,"“yes?” i said.
"
1483,"“you coming with me?”
"
1484,"“where?”
"
1485,"“do you want to be with me or ryan?”
"
1486,"this was so damn unfair. i had nothing to do with all this. yet, i had to now choose
"
1487,"between my friends.
"
1488,"“yes, go with this loser hari, go hold his hand.”
"
1489,"“t am not going anywhere,” i said.
"
1490,"“so you choose ryan,” alok said in defeated tones.
"
1491,"“t am not choosing anyone. you are the one who is leaving. do whatever you want,” i
"
1492,"said, disgusted with both of them.
"
1493,"there were no more words. alok got up and left. ryan shut the door behind him as hard
"
1494,"as he could. it was purely symbolic, as we never shut the door in our rooms.
"
1495,"“you saw what he did. and he expected you to go with him, ha!” ryan said.
"
1496,"“fuck you,” i said.
"
1497,"i met neha soon after, though i was getting sick of the ice-cream parlour, and of the
"
1498,"sickeningly sweet strawberr y flavour. neha still looked beautiful as hell, but i didn’t feel
"
1499,"like talking to her. in fact, i did not feel like talking to anyone.
"
1500,"“what’s wrong?”
"
1501,"“who said anything was wrong?” i said. i can be quite a prick if i want.
"
1502,"“tt 1s all over your face. now are you going to tell me or what?”
"
1503,"that is the thing with girls. they are like half your size or something, but if they know you
"
1504,"like them, they boss you around. who the hell did she think she was?
"
1505,"“tt is nothing.”
"
1506,"she placed her hand over my arm and self-respecting nitwit that i am, i melted faster than
"
1507,"the ice-cream, like the bad mood bugs running through me suddenly got baygon-sprayed.
"
1508,"“neha, those bloody alok and ryan.”
"
1509,"“language!”
"
1510,"“sorry, i mean my friends, my best friends, they had this massive argument and now our
"
1511,"group has split.”
"
1512,"“what was the argument about?”
"
1513,"“about grades. alok said it was ryan’s fault we did badly.”
"
1514,"“really, how badly?”
"
1515,"i told her about our five-pointer grades.
"
1516,"“damn, did you say five-pointers?” she said.
"
1517,"“language!” i said.
"
1518,"“oh sorry. i mean that is kind of low by insti standards.”
"
1519,"see that 1s the thing. once you get a gpa in iit, everyone has an opinion about it, about
"
1520,"you, even if it’s a fashion design student.
"
1521,"“t know,” i said, “but that 1s not what iam upset about. it 1s this place. i hate it.”
"
1522,"neha started laughing. i told you, didn’t i, she can be a bit loony at times. “what is there
"
1523,"to laugh about?” i asked, irritated.
"
1524,"“nothing. just how people would die to get in here.”
"
1525,"“t know,” i said, “but it sucks. i have tons to study, my grades are crap, and i don’t have
"
1526,"friends anymore.”
"
1527,"“so alok wants to mug, and he goes to the mugger,” she paraphrased the recent events
"
1528,"after i had told her the longhand version, “but how come you chose ryan?”
"
1529,"“t didn’t choose, alok left,” i reminded her.
"
1530,"“what are you going to do?”
"
1531,"i shrugged.
"
1532,"“you know my dad was a 10 when he was a student.”
"
1533,"“he was a student?” i had never thought of cherian as anything less in size or years.
"
1534,"“yes, a class topper. guess he wouldn’t be too happy to know i am with a five-pointer,”
"
1535,"she said happily.
"
1536,"“so now you also want to stop talking to me,” i said.
"
1537,"“no silly. iam joking,” she said and laughed. why does she do this all the time, tell jokes
"
1538,"that are funny to her alone?
"
1539,"“whatever.”
"
1540,"“come here,” she said, tapping the seat next to her in the parlour.
"
1541,"“why?”
"
1542,"“just come here.”
"
1543,"like a trained pet, i got up from the seat opposite and sat next to her; pretty girls have this
"
1544,"power to turn mary, making lambs out of people.
"
1545,"she held my hand and turned her face toward me. “t like this five pointer,” she said, and
"
1546,"kissed my cheek.
"
1547,"“one, two, three, four, five,” she listed, smacking my right cheek each time. “see, now
"
1548,"that isn’t too bad.”
"
1549,"damn, i was melting again. “can i kiss you back?”
"
1550,"“no, i don’t have a gpa,” she pointed out.
"
1551,"i loved people who did not have a gpa. i loved anyone who was not at iit. i did not
"
1552,"want to go back. i wondered if i could work at the ice-cream parlour, filling cones all day
"
1553,"and never have to worry about classes, courses, grades, and alok-ryan arguments.
"
1554,"“let’s see a movie, how about saturday next?” she asked.
"
1555,"“sure,” i said, snapping out of my fantasy of working in the parlour.
"
1556,"“great. gotta go now. i'll pick you up from this parlour at two. matinee show,” she said
"
1557,"and left.
"
1558,"i waited for five minutes, read the list of five daily specials and thought about the five
"
1559,"kisses. somehow, it made up for my five-point gpa.
"
1560,"how i wished i had got a higher gpa, if only to get more of those ice-creamy kisses!
"
1561," 
"
1562,"alok speaks
"
1563,"fatso, cry-baby, mugger, traitor, sissy, that is how i come across to you. you
"
1564,"probably picture me as this boy who refuses to grow up, the perennial prodigy who wants
"
1565,"to show his good report card to his parents year after year. you are free to judge me, my
"
1566,"whining over grades, my splitting with the group, my reticence to cut apron strings, an
"
1567,"umbilical cord that stretches out across delhi all the way from rohini colony to the iit
"
1568,"campus, binding me to mother.
"
1569,"allow me, however, to tell you this my way, for yes, this is alok gupta, and his
"
1570,"highness hari has given me an itsy-bitsy space here to give vent to my feelings. but
"
1571,"before i do that, let me tell you a story.
"
1572,"once upon a time, there lived a boy in a lower-middle class home in one of the suburbs
"
1573,"of delhi. let us call this boy loser — just to make it easier — whose father and mother
"
1574,"were schoolteachers, art and biology respectively. loser grew up in a simple home filled
"
1575,"with notebooks and canvases, and learnt how to draw before learning to tie his
"
1576,"shoelaces. loser was good in studies (owing to two teachers looking over him at home),
"
1577,"but what he loved most was to paint. loser took part in every art competition for his age,
"
1578,"and won most of them. the prizes kept coming in — and dozens of painting sets,
"
1579,"calligraphy sets and stationery coupons later, it was clear loser was above average at
"
1580,"the easel. he wanted to be an artist when he grew up, and of course, this was a silly
"
1581,"dream. for in india, there is only room for one or maybe two artists who are ninety years
"
1582,"old (or better still, dead) to survive. yet loser did not care, he knew he would make it and
"
1583,"nothing could stop him from his goal.
"
1584,"but that is when life screws you. right at moments when you feel you have got it all
"
1585,"figured out. loser’s father got this prestigious mural painting job, which for once paid
"
1586,"well. the job involved painting the ceiling of the lobby in the education department
"
1587,"building. murals are hard anyway, and painting a ceiling is excruciating work. they put
"
1588,"these bamboos upon which the artist lies down and works, and hopes to create that one
"
1589,"masterpiece that will make the world crane their necks and take notice.
"
1590,"however, the only time people noticed losers father was when he fell down from the
"
1591,"bamboo structure, ten meters down, and that was to step out of his way lest they broke his
"
1592,"fall.
"
1593,"right side paralysis, doctors said. half of loser’ father was gone, but more
"
1594,"importantly, the whole of his salary was gone, the right hand that painted was gone and
"
1595,"so was loser & dream.
"
1596,"loser father came home bed-ridden and never left it for ten years. his one good eye
"
1597,"shed tears every now and then, and the sorrow of never painting again brought one
"
1598,"infection after the other.
"
1599,"soon, the bottles of paint were swapped with bottles of medicine. there was no money
"
1600,"to afford a nurse, and loser was appointed one. he was in class seven then, and for the
"
1601,"rest of his school years he sat next to his father 8 bed after school.
"
1602,"for a while he painted, but soon he realized the family needed money more than
"
1603,"landscapes. itt, the one college in the country that virtually guaranteed a future, caught
"
1604,"his eye. yes, to become an engineer was the only way out of poverty.
"
1605,"losers mother used to cry every night. but she could not give up. she had to keep on
"
1606,"teaching the digestive system and the endocrine system and reproductive system year
"
1607,"after year to go on.
"
1608,"“one day, they will be out of this,” loser vowed to himself as he helped his father
"
1609,"change sides at night and studied pulleys, magnetism and calculus for the iit entrance
"
1610,"exam. for two years, loser did not step out of the house apart from school, gained fifteen
"
1611,"kilos and muttered calculations while wiping bed-sores.
"
1612,"and one fine day he made it. he was in the iit? how happy his mother and half-a-
"
1613,"father were. yes, four more years of discipline and he could emancipate everyone. that is
"
1614,"when he met ryan and hari. and then, to remain with them, he screwed up his grades to
"
1615,"the lowest in the institute.
"
1616,"ryan, the man who lives for the moment, who does not want to be like him? rich
"
1617,"parents, good looks, smart enough to get into iit, athletic enough to be good in sports
"
1618,"and fun enough to always attract friends. ryan is infectious, and hari is a perfect
"
1619,"example of this infection. if ryan wants something, hari gives it to him. so, if ryan does
"
1620,"not want to study, hari will close his books. if ryan thinks gfas are not important, then
"
1621,"hari stops caring about them. ryan is pied piper...
"
1622,"i remember when he came home once, he lifted my father to carry him out, and kept
"
1623,"holding him even in the auto. it was he who argued with the hospital staff to get us a
"
1624,"good bed, and then stayed with us until three a.m. yes, ryan is good, he is very, very
"
1625,"good. for who would have broken coke bottles for unknown freshers? or who would
"
1626,"have screwed up his new scooter and overloaded it with three people, two of them in
"
1627,"possession of large butts?
"
1628,"but there is more to ryan. like did you know his parents send him a letter every other
"
1629,"week? or that he never replies to any of them? yes, he will tell you he doesnt love them
"
1630,"or whatever crap he dishes out. but the truth is, he keeps every letter neatly in a file.
"
1631,"when he is alone in his room at night, he opens the letters and reads them again. i mean,
"
1632,"if he is so cool and everything, why can't he respond to them occasionally? and why does
"
1633,"he keep re-reading those letters anyway? i always knew ryan had issues but hari is
"
1634,"blind.
"
1635,"see, even though i think i have figured out ryan somewhat, i cannot for the hell of it
"
1636,"understand hari. i mean, he really is like me — ordinary, unattractive, fat and dull. but he
"
1637,"wants to be somebody else — someone cool, smart and sharp like ryan. but deep down, he
"
1638,"knows that this is not possible. he will always remain the under-confident kid who turns
"
1639,"corpse during viva. the uncool cannot become cool. if only he’d accept that, he would be
"
1640,"able to think straight. but he doesnt, and so went along with operation pendulum.
"
1641,"when i first split up with them, i was really not sure if i had done the right thing. but
"
1642,"after operation pendulum, i am not sure if i should have ever come back. well, that is
"
1643,"life. it screws you right when you think you have figured it out.
"
1644,"one year later
"
1645,"i knew 365 days had passed since alok left us because third semester
"
1646,"results had just come out that day. how irrelevant they seemed now; another five point
"
1647,"something, another tattoo stamped on your worth as an individual in iit society. ryan and i
"
1648,"had gone to the insti to see the results, but that was incidental, the real reason was to chill
"
1649,"out on the insti roof.
"
1650,"i don’t remember when we first discovered this roof, it must have been soon after we
"
1651,"started smoking grass, which was soon after we had started vodka, which was soon after we
"
1652,"had started listening to pink floyd. floyd, vodka, grass and the insti roof: finally, we were
"
1653,"on to what really mattered in life, the stuff that made iit life bearable, especially when you
"
1654,"were a five-point something.
"
1655,"the giant insti building had nine stories; one had to take the clandestine service stairs on
"
1656,"the ninth floor to get to the roof. there was an old lock guarding the entrance to the terrace,
"
1657,"but thankfully the bolt was even more ancient. it took ryan three minutes with a screwdriver
"
1658,"to remove the rusted bolt and then we were on cloud nine, the highest point on campus. the
"
1659,"bare, rough concrete surface made up the flat patch of terrace, there was no parapet. it was
"
1660,"mostly empty, too, apart from the insti-bell tower, and a few dish antennas that helped the
"
1661,"computer and telecom networks. after dark, only the stars above were visible. if one stood
"
1662,"up and looked down, one could see the street lights on campus roads and distant views of
"
1663,"kumaon and other hostels a kilometre away.
"
1664,"ryan laid out the vodka, the joints and his small walkman in autopilot, familiar with our
"
1665,"twice a week routine.
"
1666,"we lay down on the concrete, still warm from the sunlight in the day. ryan divided the
"
1667,"pair of earphones, such that we had one earphone each, passed a joint to me, and we kept
"
1668,"the vodka bottle in the center. sip, puff, sip, rewind, stop and play.
"
1669,"the lyrics washed over us and we flew up to the sky as it flew down at us.
"
1670,"“you see all those kids screaming over their gpa,” ryan said, releasing a smoke-ring.
"
1671,"i think smoke 1s beautiful; weightless and shapeless, it almost appears as deceptively
"
1672,"powerless as the person releasing it, yet, it comes from within and rises above us all. crap,
"
1673,"i am talking all artsy stuff, grass does this to me.
"
1674,"“yes, i saw them. and i see how they look at us,” i said.
"
1675,"“how?”
"
1676,"“like what the hell are we there for? how does our miserable gpa matter anyway? as if
"
1677,"we are blocking their view or something.”
"
1678,"“screw them,” ryan said, words of wisdom from the man who knows everything.
"
1679,"“tt’s true though,” i said, “we really serve no purpose here...”
"
1680,"“of course, we do. we are the under-performers.”
"
1681,"“so?”
"
1682,"“so we bring the average down. we make them look better. hence, we bring happiness in
"
1683,"their lives.”
"
1684,"“point,” i conceded.
"
1685,"“but it is not the students that bother me. it 1s the profs.”
"
1686,"“you are talking about the design class right?”
"
1687,"“yes, that prof bhatia. i mean you were there, right? i gave him some ideas on how one
"
1688,"could design a suspension bridge and he got all excited. he told me to make a scale drawing
"
1689,"and submit it, said he would give me a special internship project. then he asked me my
"
1690,"name and found out my gpa. so then he calls me and says to forget about the drawing and
"
1691,"internship. can you believe that scum?” ryan said.
"
1692,"we had finished one joint each. ryan sat up to make another one, crushing the grass and
"
1693,"tobacco hard, as if it were prof bhatia’s innards.
"
1694,"“screw him,” i passed the words of wisdom back to ryan.
"
1695,"we refilled our glasses, as it turned dark on the roof.
"
1696,"“yes, screw all profs,” ryan said.
"
1697,"“yeah. though prof veera 1s all right.” prof veera was our fluid mechanics professor.
"
1698,"“yes, not him. though i have heard the worst one is yet to come,” ryan said as he lit up
"
1699,"the second joint.
"
1700,"“who?” i debated whether i should smoke more. ryan’s tolerance was much higher and
"
1701,"he could probably make a wholesome meal out of dope but i knew i was getting trippy. for
"
1702,"one thing, i felt i was feather-light; up here, it felt like i was floating above the world.
"
1703,"screw all profs, all students and all design assignments.
"
1704,"“prof cherian.”
"
1705,"“neha’s dad?” i said, somewhat returning to my senses.
"
1706,"“yes. they say he’s a real terror. like he is the head of the department, and 1s this total
"
1707,"control freak with other profs and students.”
"
1708,"i knew neha’s dad was a control freak, at least with his daughter. “who told you?”
"
1709,"“tt 1s well known, ask any senior. anyway, for the record, anurag told me.”
"
1710,"“so when does the control freak teach us?”
"
1711,"“next year. he takes third year courses,” ryan said.
"
1712,"“next year, too far. give me another joint.”
"
1713,"there were still more than two years to leave this place. and the worst prof was yet to
"
1714,"come. i deserved another joint.
"
1715,"“here,” ryan said, passing me the crude cigarette. he was a good pal, one who rolls
"
1716,"joints for you.
"
1717,"“anyway, i don’t want to talk about grades or profs. talk about something else,” i said.
"
1718,"ryan stayed silent; i guess he was searching for another topic.
"
1719,"“how 1s your girl?” he asked after straining his brain for twenty seconds.
"
1720,"that is how ryan addresses neha. he never says her name, as if her being ‘my girl’ is
"
1721,"more important than her being neha.
"
1722,"“neha is great. going for a movie next week.”
"
1723,"“so you guys serious?”
"
1724,"“serious about what?”
"
1725,"“t don’t know, like you love her and everything?”
"
1726,"“t don’t know,” i said.
"
1727,"that is how men talk about their relationships. nobody knows anything — neither the
"
1728,"questioner nor the answerer.
"
1729,"“has she said anything?”
"
1730,"“well, you know how she is. so damn moody all the time. sometimes she is all cuddly,
"
1731,"holds my hand, and acts cozy at the movies. but when i try something, she stops me and
"
1732,"gives me these lectures on how she is a decent girl and i should learn to behave.”
"
1733,"“what do you do? you are a bastard i know,” ryan said and started laughing. screw him.
"
1734,"that is the thing with people who know you well, they judge you before they hear you out.
"
1735,"“t do nothing. like i mean, do you know we have not even kissed yet. like i have met her
"
1736,"twenty times, but every time i get the push. she has like this under-the-elbow policy.”
"
1737,"“sounds like a nice girl. you’re lucky.”
"
1738,"“screw nice. i don’t want nice.”
"
1739,"that is true, nice people are completely boring. they don’t give you joints, and they don’t
"
1740,"let you kiss them.
"
1741,"“talk to her then. tell her to be naughty. i am sure she wants to be bad,” ryan said.
"
1742,"“are you crazy? she is a girl; girls never want to be bad.”
"
1743,"“they do. just that they want it a little less than us.”
"
1744,"i couldn’t imagine neha wanting to do the same things i wanted to do with her. “i don’t
"
1745,"believe you. did you ever have a girlfriend?” i said.
"
1746,"“then don’t believe. anyway, enough talk about women. time for another drink and
"
1747,"tape,” ryan said.
"
1748,"ryan never talked much about himself. sometimes, i wondered if he was gay. but he
"
1749,"wasn’t, i mean, i would have known. i practically lived with the guy, and unless he found
"
1750,"me hideously unattractive, i think i would have known. but he wasn’t gay, for he did notice
"
1751,"the heroines in movies, whistled at pretty girls on the street. maybe he just wasn’t in the
"
1752,"mood for women most of the time.
"
1753,"he changed the tape and put on another pink floyd. i saw the levels of the vodka bottle
"
1754,"drop and ryan scraping through his brown bag for the last joint of the day. a half-moon lit
"
1755,"up the sky, and bright little stars looked smug, winking down at us like students with higher
"
1756,"gpas.
"
1757,"you know the thing about floyd? not only are they damn good, they sound better with
"
1758,"every drink, like the singers designed them for alcohol. like samosas-chutney, 1dli-sambhar
"
1759,"or rajma-chawal, floyd and vodka are in a combo-class of their own.
"
1760,"“you know what today reminds me of?” ryan said.
"
1761,"“what?”
"
1762,"“the first sem results. you remember?”
"
1763,"“yes, i do. the first fiver.”
"
1764,"“and after that.”
"
1765,"“what?”
"
1766,"“fatso left us.”
"
1767,"ryan still referred to him as fatso and even though it is derogatory, it was always laced
"
1768,"with indulgence. i know ryan had not spoken to alok for the entire past year and he
"
1769,"wouldn’t let me as well. “don’t go to him. he left us,” he said, and i knew ryan would do
"
1770,"some serious sulking if i rebelled.
"
1771,"“how come you thought of alok today?” i asked, rising to see how much vodka
"
1772,"remained. surely, ryan had drunk too much to be talking this.
"
1773,"“t just mentioned him today. i think of him more often.”
"
1774,"ryan in a profound mood. grass and vodka have mixed to optimal levels.
"
1775,"“screw him,” i said as the song reached some of my favourite lines.
"
1776,"“what do you think he is doing right now?” ryan said.
"
1777,"“who?” i said, “alok?”
"
1778,"ryan nodded.
"
1779,"“probably mugging away with venkat. i hear he is a six- pointer now,” i said.
"
1780,"“you know hari, alok did the right thing.”
"
1781,"“yeah, right.”
"
1782,"“no, iam serious. you should have left me too. i am not good for you.”
"
1783,"now what is going on here, i thought. am i going to have to waste real good dope in
"
1784,"making ryan feel all wanted and better about himself? i have two options: one, to tell him to
"
1785,"shut up and enjoy the song, two, do what he wants me to do.
"
1786,"“what is the deal ryan? not feeling good?”
"
1787,"“no, iam fine. you should have left me. everyone leaves me. they must be right.”
"
1788,"“what?”
"
1789,"“they do. dad, mom, alok... they all do.”
"
1790,"“no need to be senti, ryan, just enjoy the evening.”
"
1791,"“you think fatso was right? you think i did not care for him?” he demanded.
"
1792,"i hate it when people want to be assured, you have no choice but to play ball.
"
1793,"“no ryan, alok was wrong. he will realize it someday. now just close your eyes and
"
1794,"cruise a little,” i advised.
"
1795,"i closed my eyes. the grass and vodka were now in complete control of the policeman in
"
1796,"me, making me see what i wanted to see. i saw neha sitting next to me, smiling and
"
1797,"embracing me. her hair, and especially that one soft, floppy lock, brushes me. her round
"
1798,"faces resembles the moon, or is it that i am actually watching the moon? this 1s trippy and
"
1799,"the grass is getting the better of me but i want to be gotten the better of. i continued drifting
"
1800,"until ryan interrupted me.
"
1801,"“you know the best thing about the insti roof?” he stood up, towering over me.
"
1802,"“that no one knows we are here.”
"
1803,"“no. the fact that you always have an option.”
"
1804,"“what option.”
"
1805,"“you can jump over the edge and end it all.”
"
1806,"“shut up, ryan.” i struggled to sit up.
"
1807,"“i’m serious. they can do whatever, but i can still control my options.”
"
1808,"“you are too drunk ryan, i want to go back,” i said, sobering up fast. sometimes, you
"
1809,"want your commonsense to get the better of you.
"
1810,"we never missed the fluid mechanics class in the fourth sem and the reason was prof veera.
"
1811,"that and the fact that the class was at noon and we finally woke up by then. prof veera was
"
1812,"completely different. for one, he was like twenty years younger than other profs. no more
"
1813,"than thirty, he dressed in jeans and t-shirt, which bore his us university logos. he had like
"
1814,"five degrees from all the top universities — mit, cornell, princeton etc, and t-shirts from all
"
1815,"of them. he carried this cd-man with him, and after class, he would plug it into his ears
"
1816,"before he left. students said prof veera had just joined the insti, and was not supposed to be
"
1817,"taking a full course so early. however, the prof he was assisting had a heart attack or
"
1818,"something, and prof veera had to teach us.
"
1819,"“hi everyone,” prof veera said as he entered class. he offered chewing gum to the first
"
1820,"row students. the front row guys were all mugging nine-pointers, and freaked out at his
"
1821,"offer. they declined, and he shrugged and popped a piece in his mouth and turned to the
"
1822,"board.
"
1823,"“turbulent flows,” he wrote in big letters on the board.
"
1824,"“guys, in the first five lectures, we studied simple flows called laminar flows. the shape
"
1825,"and direction of these flows are predictable with the help of formulas and equations. you
"
1826,"know which equation, right?”
"
1827,"he looked around for answers. unlike other profs, he did not stick to the first row. in fact,
"
1828,"he scavenged at the back. “okay, i am not going to ask the studious kids all the questions. i
"
1829,"want to ask the cool dudes at the back.”
"
1830,"ryan and i were chronic backbenchers; out of sight, this was the most defensive position
"
1831,"for the outcaste five-pointers, but prof veera did not care.
"
1832,"“ryan, tell me, which is the first principle equation for laminar flows?”
"
1833,"“sir, me?” ryan said, surprised that a prof would know his name.
"
1834,"“yes you, ryan. i know you know the answer.”
"
1835,"“the navier-stokes equation.”
"
1836,"“right. you want to write 1t down for the class?”
"
1837,"ryan ran up to the board and the nine-pointers in the front row smirked at a five-pointer
"
1838,"contributing to class. the equation was right though; ryan doesn’t go up to the board unless
"
1839,"he knows he’s right.
"
1840,"“perfect, thanks ryan. by the way, was it you who wrote the impact of lubricant
"
1841,"efficiency on scooter fuel consumption in your last term paper?”
"
1842,"“well, yes sir.”
"
1843,"“ts it true you actually tested the data on your scooter?”
"
1844,"“yes i did, sir. not accurately though.”
"
1845,"“t like that,” prof veera said, looking at the nine-pointers who were busy taking frantic
"
1846,"notes like trained parrots. “i really like that.”
"
1847,"ryan came back to his seat. i could tell he loved fluid mechanics, and most of all, he
"
1848,"loved prof veera. he never missed flumech and he would do anything for prof veera.
"
1849,"others however — the testy design prof, the painfully dull solid mechanics prof and the
"
1850,"assignment-maniac thermodynamics prof — were a different story. ryan could cut up their
"
1851,"guts with a lathe machine in the machining workshop given a chance.
"
1852,"i met neha at priya cinema a week after the flumech class. i would have said i met my
"
1853,"girlfriend but the damn problem was i was still not sure. i had known her for over a year,
"
1854,"but she called me different things depending on her mood. first, i was just a friend. then i
"
1855,"was a good friend, then a friend who was special, then really-really good and special
"
1856,"friends or some such crap. for her, calling someone a boyfriend was a big thing. her dad
"
1857,"had made her promise that she would never have a boyfriend, and she wanted to keep it. of
"
1858,"course, it did not prevent her from watching movies with me hand in hand every two weeks
"
1859,"for over a year.
"
1860,"“late again?” she said. i must have been late by like two minutes.
"
1861,"“had flumech class. prof veera overshot time and we did not even realize it.”
"
1862,"“prof veera is that young guy right?”
"
1863,"“yes, you know him?”
"
1864,"“not really. dad mentions him. i think my dad hates him.”
"
1865,"“your dad sounds like a total...”
"
1866,"she raised her eyebrows.
"
1867,"“let’s go in. i don’t want to miss the trailers.”
"
1868,"the movie was jotal recall, another sci-fi action crap. that’s the thing about english
"
1869,"theatres in delhi. they either show action or adult movies. i don’t mind the latter except that
"
1870,"you can’t really take a girl to them. especially these really nice and good-indian-traditional
"
1871,"girls like neha. so, you have the choice of sci-fi action nonsense or a hindi movie. no self-
"
1872,"respecting girl will watch a hindi movie on a date. hence, there i was again, to watch
"
1873,"arnold flex his muscles and blow up planets.
"
1874,"“you like sci-fi,” she said as she took her seat.
"
1875,"“it do,” i said. what choice did i have anyway?
"
1876,"“typical iit engineer.”
"
1877,"yeah right. typical iit engineers, my girl, don’t skip design class to watch stupid movies.
"
1878,"and then just when i thought it couldn’t get worse, it did. neha and i took our seats in the
"
1879,"balcony (rs 35/ticket, total rip-off) and waited for the trailers to begin. however, according
"
1880,"to a new government regulation, the theatre had to screen a ‘family planning documentary’
"
1881,"first.
"
1882,"okay, so india has this big population. so maybe people should just use some protection
"
1883,"and we would have less new people. simple enough, right? so you would think. apparently,
"
1884,"nobody wants to use contraception, so the government has to show people a more permanent
"
1885,"way to not have kids.
"
1886,"the documentary began; a doctor in a government hospital introduced himself with a
"
1887,"beatific smile. he was supposed to be your friend in family planning, though i think he was
"
1888,"the angel of death, especially when he recommended one sure shot procedure — vasectomy.
"
1889,"the documentary showed this mill worker who had this idyllic home where he lived with
"
1890,"his simple wife (who cooked all the time) and two kids. then one day he sleeps and has a
"
1891,"dream that he has six kids or something (obviously that would have taken a lot of screwing
"
1892,"his wife, but they skipped all that). the kids need more food, education, toys and keep
"
1893,"asking dad for more. but dad 1s tired from the mill job (not to mention the screwing) and
"
1894,"breaks down. that is when our friend in family planning or angel of death appears.
"
1895,"the doctor had this portable flip-chart with a picture of the male anatomy. he opened it,
"
1896,"and the whole theatre, especially the front rows, started hooting. (theatres are the opposite
"
1897,"of class lectures, the front row is where the action 1s.)
"
1898,"anyway, so all this is going on when i am on my date. i had never approached the topic of
"
1899,"sex (let alone controlling sex) with neha. but there he was, the angel of death, showing the
"
1900,"exact location of the cuts so that the male organ came under control. i was embarrassed like
"
1901,"every other man in the balcony.
"
1902,"neha looked at me, noticing i was shifting around in my seat.
"
1903,"“you all right?”
"
1904,"“don’t you think this 1s too much? why do they have show this indecent stuff?”
"
1905,"“what? it is educational.”
"
1906,"“yeah, right. i need that when i come to see a movie.”
"
1907,"“oh come on hari. i actually think it is pretty funny.”
"
1908,"the wife on screen listened carefully to the doctor and smiled at the prospect of sex
"
1909,"without any consequences. i think the doctor and the wife had a thing going, but that was just
"
1910,"my imagination.
"
1911,"to the relief of all, the documentary ended in like half an hour. the mill worker wakes up
"
1912,"and realizes how he must control his family and signs his reproductive facilities away.
"
1913,"happy ending, smiling faces of wife and kids which turn into cartoons, and the inverted
"
1914,"triangle of the population control department. ‘small family happy family’ was the last
"
1915,"nugget of wisdom thrown at us before trigger-happy arnold took over the screen.
"
1916,"neha held my hand as the movie began. she had grown comfortable with doing this and i
"
1917,"could not hope for anything more. i remembered my last conversation with ryan. could
"
1918,"neha also secretly want to do more than hold hands? could i just ask her? should i just
"
1919,"make a bold move?
"
1920,"we went to nirula’s after the movie for a meal. “so, what is prof veera like, tell me,”
"
1921,"neha said, cutting the pizza we ordered into equal-sized pieces. girls love organizing food
"
1922,"on a table.
"
1923,"“he 1s really different,” i said. “like he doesn’t discriminate between nine-pointers and
"
1924,"five-pointers. and he likes original thinking. even his assignments push you to think more.”
"
1925,"“like how?”
"
1926,"“like he gave a term paper asking students to think about an engineering problem linked
"
1927,"to fluid mechanics. most profs would have just said, ‘do all the numericals at the end of
"
1928,"chapter 10’ or something, but prof veera invites ideas.”
"
1929,"“sounds cool. is he good looking?”
"
1930,"“t think so.”
"
1931,"“then i should tr y to see him. maybe pll ask dad to invite him home,” she said and
"
1932,"laughed.
"
1933,"a surge of jealousy rose within me. somehow prof veera didn’t seem so nice anymore.
"
1934,"“go to hell.”
"
1935,"“hey, are you getting jealous?”
"
1936,"“no, why should i get jealous? i’m not your boyfriend.”
"
1937,"neha laughed really hard. jokes only she finds funny. stupid woman, i feel like cutting off
"
1938,"her cute lock of hair.
"
1939,"“t am just kidding, silly,” she said. “in any case my dad will kill me for that. and he hates
"
1940,"him anyway. but it 1s nice to see you all worked up.”
"
1941,"“tm not.”
"
1942,"she held my hand, though she hadn’t stopped laughing. what is so funny to women all the
"
1943,"time? and why do i still find her so beautiful? and why the hell can’t i kiss her?
"
1944,"she stopped laughing and got back her composure. “sorry, hari. don’t feel bad, you are
"
1945,"my sweetest little special friend.”
"
1946,"now what is that? another title for the fortm ght?
"
1947,"she bent forward to kiss my cheek. now is my chance, i thought. give her the illusion that
"
1948,"you don’t care then as soon as her mouth comes to the cheek, jerk once and move your lips
"
1949,"there instead. this is the only way to kiss good indian women, ryan told me.
"
1950,"“what are you doing?” neha pulled back.
"
1951,"i tried to look innocent.
"
1952,"“were you trying to kiss me on the lips?”
"
1953,"“no.”
"
1954,"“hari, you know i am not into that.”
"
1955,"then what the hell are you into? funny private jokes? or your stuck-up father?
"
1956,"“because this is wrong. this spoils everything. because it feels wrong. you are not a
"
1957,"girl, you won’t understand.”
"
1958,"yes, i wanted to say, and you are not a guy, so you will not understand. so, should we just
"
1959,"eat our pizza and go home? i didn’t say anything. i had lost my chance, and right then even
"
1960,"my desire. besides, her face had turned sad. i didn’t want her to be upset. because we fixed
"
1961,"our next date at the end of the meal. i didn’t want to not fix the next date. “this pizza is
"
1962,"good.”
"
1963,"“you want to meet next thursday?”
"
1964,"“sure.”
"
1965,"“t have to buy a gift for a friend’s birthday. will you come to connaught place with me?”
"
1966,"i agreed. i was sick of priya and all the overpriced dating alternatives around it.
"
1967,"“cool. pll get the car, and pick you up from the ice-cream parlour,” she said.
"
1968,"i scraped through the crumbs on the pizza plate without looking up.
"
1969,"“venkat, i have certain responsibilities...” alok said.
"
1970,"“but they aren’t my problem are they? this 1s the third time this month. it 1s about time i
"
1971,"stop listening to this sort of stuff,” venkat said, interrupting him.
"
1972,"it was a chilly february night. the noise came from inside venkat’s room. ryan and i
"
1973,"were in the corridor of our wing, returning from one of our visits to the canteen.
"
1974,"“why are they talking so loudly?” ryan said.
"
1975,"“t don’t know. normally muggu venkat’s room 1s pretty quiet.”
"
1976,"ryan put his ear on venkat’s door.
"
1977,"“what are you doing?” i said.
"
1978,"“shh... i think they’re having an argument.”
"
1979,"“what do we have to do with it? let’s go,” i said.
"
1980,"“shh... come here,” ryan said.
"
1981,"at some level, even i was curious about the argument. was it a big one? what was it
"
1982,"about? i put my ear on the door, and every word could be heard loud and clear.
"
1983,"“alok, this 1s too much. i mean, i have to study for ten hours a day to keep my gpa. the
"
1984,"least i can expect is to count on my group partners,” venkat was saying.
"
1985,"“my dad has become unconscious. we are worried he may have had a stroke! two calls
"
1986,"have come from home...” alok said.
"
1987,"“listen, your mom always overplays your dad’s illness. he will recover, how will your
"
1988,"making a trip help?”
"
1989,"“t am the only man in the house venkat. i want to go. can’t you take care of it this time?”
"
1990,"“actually, no. i have to study class notes for other subjects. i don’t think you realize this, i
"
1991,"mean how would you being a five-point something,” venkat said.
"
1992,"“realize what?” alok said.
"
1993,"“that i have to maintain my rank. the second guy in the department is only 0.03 behind
"
1994,"me you know. now should i finish this group assignment or read my notes?” venkat said, or
"
1995,"rather shouted.
"
1996,"“bloody mugger,” ryan whispered in my ear. i signalled ryan to keep quiet.
"
1997,"“venkat you study all the time. can’t you just...” alok said.
"
1998,"“t am a nine-pointer, do you understand? j have to maintain my position!” venkat said,
"
1999,"speaking more to remind himself than to tell alok.
"
2000,"“but am i not your friend? you know i have to take care of my dad,” alok said, this time
"
2001,"pleading more than protesting. “enough!” venkat said, “this assignment 1s worth ten percent.
"
2002,"alok, you can’t go.”
"
2003,"“venkat please,” alok said, and voice started to sound like his mother’s, which meant he
"
2004,"was going to cry soon.
"
2005,"“this is too much, i am going in,” ryan said, kicking the door open. i would have tried to
"
2006,"stop him, but ryan acted 1n a nanosecond.
"
2007,"alok was standing next to venkat, who sat on the study chair. they turned toward us in
"
2008,"surprise.
"
2009,"“what the...” venkat said, “ryan, what are you doing here?”
"
2010,"it was a valid question. what was a five-pointer doing in a nine-pointer’s room? venkat
"
2011,"looked at ryan as if a person searching for a bar had reached a temple.
"
2012,"“what’s the problem?” ryan said, completely ignoring venkat.
"
2013,"i stood there silently, checking out venkat’s room. apart from a bed and a few clothes,
"
2014,"there were just books, books and more books.
"
2015,"“ryan, 1t has got nothing to do with you,” alok said. i could tell he was shocked to see
"
2016,"ryan, yet somewhere deep down, like he felt his saviour was there.
"
2017,"the pathetic “i-will-cry-any-moment’ expression had vanished.
"
2018,"“t said, what’s the problem?” ryan said.
"
2019,"“pll tell you what the problem 1s,” venkat said. “we have a thermo assignment due
"
2020,"tomorrow, and alok and i are in the same group. it is ten percent. yet, he wants to go
"
2021,"home...”
"
2022,"“t am not off on some tour, dad 1s really sick,” alok said.
"
2023,"“do you want me to go?” ryan asked.
"
2024,"i was left puzzled. one year of silence, and now this sudden offer of help.
"
2025,"did ryan really want to get back with alok or was he just proving what a prick venkat
"
2026,"was?
"
2027,"“huh? you? where...home?” alok said.
"
2028,"“yes, i know where you live and i have taken your dad to the hospital before. i have a
"
2029,"scooter too and will get there faster. or, if you need to go, then i can help you fimsh the
"
2030,"assignment, except i don’t want to work with this mugger bastard friend of yours,” said
"
2031,"ryan, stressing on the word ‘friend’.
"
2032,"this was too much. ryan was acting like a mother teresa for alok. the person alok had
"
2033,"insulted and left, was today a cure-all fairy from heaven. i looked at venkat, who looked
"
2034,"like a younger version of any of the anally retentive profs in the institute. he had put enough
"
2035,"oil in his hair to cook an entire kumaon dinner, his forehead sported an ash-mark from his
"
2036,"devout prayers. yet, at that moment, it was ryan who looked like an angel.
"
2037,"“really?” alok said.
"
2038,"“so i go then,” ryan said and stood up. alok nodded and ryan left the room.
"
2039,"we remained silent for a minute. ryan had solved a problem that could save a sick man’s
"
2040,"life and offer a nine-point mugger a future. all with a scooter ride to alok’s home.
"
2041,"“well, that settles it then. i'll leave you to do the thermal assignment,” i said and stood up
"
2042,"to leave the room.
"
2043,"“wait,” alok said.
"
2044,"“what?” i said.
"
2045,"alok walked out of the room with me. wasting no time, venkat took out the
"
2046,"thermodynamics book, giving alok a glance which meant “come back soon’.
"
2047,"“thanks,” alok said.
"
2048,"“thank ryan,” i said.
"
2049,"“yes, i will. is he still mad at me?”
"
2050,"“obviously not, or why would he have gone to your house?”
"
2051,"“but you know ryan, he could do things for you and yet be mad at you.”
"
2052,"“yes, he can sulk. but what difference does it make. just thank him later.” i was getting
"
2053,"irritated with alok. i didn’t think he had the right to say he knew ryan anymore, certainly
"
2054,"not as much as me. “hari?” alok said. “you think i can come back?” “come back where?” i
"
2055,"was bewildered. “you know, the three of us again.” “why? venkat isn’t working out for
"
2056,"you?” “t didn’t know what i was doing man. i want to move back.” i couldn’t believe my
"
2057,"ears. the difference one year with an obnoxious nine-pointer can make! “you sure?”
"
2058,"“yes, iam sure.” alok’s voice was small.
"
2059,"and then, like sentimental fools, we hugged each other. i think alok was dying for a cry
"
2060,"and he shed a few tears that he always has spare. i was kind of mellow too, i’d never
"
2061,"thought the three of us could be together again. i knew ryan would do some drama, but
"
2062,"finally he would agree. if he could spend hours taking care of alok’s half-dad, he certainly
"
2063,"felt something for him. “good. welcome back then,” i said.
"
2064,"“yes. right after this damn thermal assignment though,” alok said and we laughed
"
2065,"together for the first time in over a year.
"
2066,"the mice theory
"
2067,"predictably, ryan pouted over prodigal alok’s return but not for too long
"
2068,"as it was kind of pointless. after alok had shed yet more tears, we all bear-hugged and just
"
2069,"like that we were back to being a group once again. venkat’s hissed curses we ignored
"
2070,"happily because he had his books, but we had each other.
"
2071,"ryan threw a party to mark the historical event. he did the arrangements himself and that
"
2072,"included cleaning up his room — a herculean task in itself given he had not disturbed the
"
2073,"layers of dust with as much as a sneeze for several months.
"
2074,"“why is he calling it the mice party though?” puzzled alok.
"
2075,"“don’t know. he has this new theory that he 1s going to launch,” i shrugged.
"
2076,"ryan had banned us from venturing near his room before the party. i heard him shout
"
2077,"“fatso, buzz off ” at least six times at alok. the guest list consisted of me, alok,
"
2078,"sukhwinder, anurag and vaibhav, who lived in the last room on our floor and always had
"
2079,"vodka in his room. to ryan that meant he was good friend-material. however, i only later
"
2080,"figured out the real criteria for the guest list; all the guests were in the five-point something
"
2081,"range of scores, were underdogs and lived in the same wing. we all anxiously waited for
"
2082,"ten o’clock for mr ryan to open his damn door.
"
2083,"“come in, guys,” ryan called out after we had waited outside his room for like an hour,
"
2084,"on the verge of going bananas.
"
2085,"we entered and it was dark, for ryan had replaced the normal bulbs in the room with red
"
2086,"ones so that a crimson hue spread over the study table, which now doubled as a bar. ryan
"
2087,"had laid out vodka and rum bottles, juice from the roadside vendor, coke from the canteen,
"
2088,"lemons, ice, sugar and finally, joints for the guests. when ready-made joints are served, you
"
2089,"know the host 1s someone who gives attention to detail.
"
2090,"that was not all. nude women adorned the walls, posters extracted from us porn
"
2091,"magazines, which made their way to kumaon through ex-seniors 1n innocuous us university
"
2092,"admission brochures via mail. blondes, brunettes, red-heads, thin, voluptuous and petite,
"
2093,"posed on ryan’s wall, uniformly wanton.
"
2094,"alok stared at the posters, his mouth open as if a ufo had landed in his kitchen-sink.
"
2095,"“these women are completely naked,” he managed to gurgle eventually.
"
2096,"thanks for the insight, alok. his quality time with venkat had made him miss out on a lot.
"
2097,"we all sat down on the floor in ryan’s room, where he had placed cushions for each
"
2098,"guest. the first drinks, the customary ‘cheers’, the challenge to execute ‘bottoms up’
"
2099,"followed and pink floyd sang to us.
"
2100,"we finished the first drink soon and ryan topped us up promptly, and then again. i knew
"
2101,"the alcohol had reached my head when i reached out for the ready-to-smoke joints; i always
"
2102,"ache for a smoke when three drinks buzz inside me.
"
2103,"surd had his own way of being drunk, by becoming overtly affectionate, kind of spilling
"
2104,"over on to others’ drunken space. he sat next to alok, putting his arm around his shoulder,
"
2105,"occasionally squeezing, rubbing.
"
2106,"“great party man. alok, are you feeling happy-happy?” surdy asked solicitously.
"
2107,"alok nodded, delicately removed surdy’s arm and moved forward to speak. “so ryan,
"
2108,"what is the big theory that you are going to launch during this party?”
"
2109,"ryan was sitting across us with anurag and vaibhav. “let’s have a good time first,” he
"
2110,"said.
"
2111,"“t am feeling very good man. tell us,” surdy said and replaced his arm around alok’s
"
2112,"shoulder.
"
2113,"“yes, yes, tell us,” anurag and vaibhav spoke in unison.
"
2114,"“guys, my theory is called the mice theory. but before i tell you that, i need you all to
"
2115,"answer one question.”
"
2116,"“what question?” anurag said.
"
2117,"“t want you to tell me exactly what you want from life.”
"
2118,"“yeah whatever,” i said, “just tell us your damn theory.” i was familiar with ryan’s
"
2119,"showman tactics. besides, my brain had too much alcohol to answer deep questions.
"
2120,"“c’mon guys, work with me on this,” ryan said, “you will appreciate this much more if
"
2121,"you think about your own life first. just one question — what do you want in life? think
"
2122,"about it for two minutes.”
"
2123,"we fell silent. ryan took a commercial break from his theory and refilled everyone’s
"
2124,"drink. i was on drink number four and i had never felt more clueless about life. i watched
"
2125,"everyone else think.
"
2126,"“okay, enough time,” ryan said, “surdy, what do you want?”
"
2127,"surdy held alok tighter and dragged him closer. then he planted a kiss on alok’s mouth
"
2128,"and whispered intimately to him, “should i tell him?”
"
2129,"alok determinedly extracted himself from the affectionate and inebriated grip again and
"
2130,"nodded.
"
2131,"“t just want to reach the us. with my gpa, it’s impossible, but just somehow, someplace,
"
2132,"somewhere i don’t know, i just want to be in the us of a,” surdy babbled.
"
2133,"anurag, muttered something about inventing a new computer language, and vaibhav
"
2134,"wanted to start his own business.
"
2135,"i could tell ryan was not too interested in the others’ life ambitions, yet he politely
"
2136,"nodded to all of them. he wanted to hear from alok and me.
"
2137,"ryan nodded at alok.
"
2138,"“well, you know it,” alok said.
"
2139,"“tell me again.”
"
2140,"“t want to get a job in delhi, so i can look after my parents and take care of our money
"
2141,"problems.”
"
2142,"“really?” ryan said, implying he did not find the response so convincing.
"
2143,"“of course,” alok said robustly.
"
2144,"“really?” surdy said again, though more out of affection than anything else.
"
2145,"“you, hari?” ryan said.
"
2146,"“t don’t know.” i really did not know what i wanted in life. i had thought about the
"
2147,"question. i did not want to have a five-point gpa, and i did not want to be fat and
"
2148,"unattractive. i also did not want to get tongue-tied in the damn vivas every semester. i mean,
"
2149,"i definitely knew what i did not want — as i had it all in that department. but knowing what i
"
2150,"really wanted was difficult.
"
2151,"“of course you know. come on, be a sport,” ryan urged.
"
2152,"sport, that is ryan’s word. ryan is always a sport. and ryan is always thin and
"
2153,"attractive. and ryan is always confident and carefree. i hated ryan. yet at that point i
"
2154,"realized what i really wanted — i wanted to be ryan.
"
2155,"“nothing much,” i said, as i tried to think of an answer. i surely could not tell ever yone i
"
2156,"wanted to be ryan; after all, ryan would never want to be someone else.
"
2157,"“still, say something man. so we can hear the theory,” alok said.
"
2158,"“t want to be able to kiss my girlfriend, and kiss her any time i want. and even do more,
"
2159,"like go all the way with her.”
"
2160,"i still don’t know why i said what i said. i mean, it was sort of true. yeah, i did want to
"
2161,"kiss neha and everything, but i had wanted to say something different.
"
2162,"“who is your girlfriend?” surdy turned to me with interest.
"
2163,"“none of your business,” ryan said briskly.
"
2164,"“anyway, tell us the theory now, sir,” alok said. two drinks down, he did not mind
"
2165,"surdy’s overtures that much anymore, settling down into the masculine embrace with a
"
2166,"resigned look behind his glasses.
"
2167,"“gentlemen,” ryan said, sitting on the bed. he was now above us all physically,
"
2168,"showering our uptilted heads with his gospel knowledge. “thank you for coming tonight. as
"
2169,"i am sure you have figured out, you are the lowest gpa holders in our wing. we are,
"
2170,"gentlemen, the underdogs. cheers to the underdogs.”
"
2171,"though ryan was shamelessly working us up, we felt special at being the failures in the
"
2172,"iit grading system, and held up our hands high to a big ‘cheers’.
"
2173,"“and this iit system is nothing but a mice race. it 1s not a rat race, mind you, as rats
"
2174,"sound somewhat shrewd and clever. so it is not about that. it 1s about mindlessly running a
"
2175,"race for four years, in every class, every assignment and every test. it is a race where profs
"
2176,"judge you every ten steps, with a gpa stamped on you ever y semester. profs who have no
"
2177,"idea what science and learning are about. yes, that is what i think of the profs. i mean, what
"
2178,"have iits given to this country? name one invention in the last three decades.”
"
2179,"silence ran through the party crowd as ryan’s speech became serious. i hoped ryan was
"
2180,"really drunk, for there was no other excuse for such patronizing crap at a party.
"
2181,"“anyway, ryan continued, “screw the profs. coming back, this system is an unfair race.
"
2182,"if you are a mouse who thinks or pauses to make friends with other runners, or stops to
"
2183,"figure out what you want to do in life, or drag baggage from the past,” ryan said, looking at
"
2184,"alok, “then you will be pushed behind. as we have been pushed behind by morons like
"
2185,"venkat.”
"
2186,"surdy blew a flying kiss. i guess that meant he approved.
"
2187,"“but we can change all that,” ryan said.
"
2188,"“how?” anurag said. at least someone was listening to this trash.
"
2189,"“by living on our own terms. by being rats, not mice, work together and beat the system. i
"
2190,"will not give up my friends for this system. in fact, my friendships will beat the system.”
"
2191,"“how?” anurag said again.
"
2192,"“that is for me and my close friends. you only get the theory, i did not say you get the
"
2193,"practicals.”
"
2194,"“we are not your friends?” surdy asked, his tone dipping emotionally.
"
2195,"“of course you are. but i can only do this with my close friends.”
"
2196,"no one else protested. if nothing else, ryan’s theory formed core entertainment at the
"
2197,"party. one vodka bottle, ten joints and three cassettes of floyd later, the speech was just
"
2198,"part of the evening. at one a.m. the others left. alok and i helped ryan clear the mess.
"
2199,"“that was a good party,” alok said.
"
2200,"“t know, fatso. you missed out on all this with the bastard venkat,’ ryan said, and
"
2201,"staggered to his feet.
"
2202,"“so, what is with the implementation of the theory? how does that work?” i spoke idly.
"
2203,"“c2d,” ryan said.
"
2204,"“what the hell is that?” it sounded like a code in those damn sci-fi movies.
"
2205,"“cooperate,” ryan said and fell on his bed, only half-intentionally.
"
2206,"“cooperate?”
"
2207,"“yes, cooperate to dominate, c2d...” ryan said and closed his eyes. all that work for
"
2208,"the party and the vodka had taken their toll. he had passed out.
"
2209,"“come, fellow mouse, let’s go to our room,” alok said.
"
2210,"the party was over.
"
2211,"i was in the machining lab with ryan when i remembered my date with neha the next day.
"
2212,"this time, madam had asked for a gift. she made this whole big deal about how i actually
"
2213,"never give her anything, and how other girls got gifts from their friends. i mean, it was
"
2214,"asinine logic if you ask me, as there were things she could be giving me, and without much
"
2215,"capital investment. to have the nerve to ask for a gift on top of this deprivation 1s something
"
2216,"only a woman can do, as they are made differently after all. anyway, i'd promised her i
"
2217,"would not come without a gift and then had totally forgotten about it.
"
2218,"“tomorrow morning?” ryan said “how will you get a gift by then?”
"
2219,"“t don’t know, i just forgot. man, will she sulk! pll just buy some chocolates, bloody
"
2220,"expensive they are though.”
"
2221,"“yeah, but chocolates? that 1s not original at all. no wonder she doesn’t give you any,”
"
2222,"ryan said.
"
2223,"“well whatever. you have any bright ideas?” i was irritated at his conclusions, which
"
2224,"were probably right.
"
2225,"“think man, think.”
"
2226,"we thought for several minutes and threw out most ideas; clothes too expensive, perfumes
"
2227,"too frivolous, books impersonal and so on. i had neither time nor taste to improvise.
"
2228,"“make something for her.” ryan snapped his fingers.
"
2229,"“what?”
"
2230,"“like, make an object right here, in the lab. a handmade original, from an engineer, how
"
2231,"neat is that?”
"
2232,"it seemed like an interesting idea, even though completely impractical. and what if she
"
2233,"was expecting me to spend some money.
"
2234,"“make what?”
"
2235,"“t don’t know. think of some simple device she could use.”
"
2236,"i tried to think of neha’s life. she had this big purse full of things. “how about a little box
"
2237,"to keep her lipsticks? they kind of keep rolling out of her purse when she takes things out.”
"
2238,"“now you are thinking customer needs. ok, lipstick box. how many lipsticks max?”
"
2239,"“three... four.”
"
2240,"“and size of a lipstick?”
"
2241,"“no idea. say three inches by one inch by one inch.”
"
2242,"“cool. so, say we stack them two by two...and then we design with sheet metal of
"
2243,"thickness...”
"
2244,"i saw ryan transform from the irreverent iit underdog he purported to be into this
"
2245,"passionate scientist over my stupid lipstick box. for the first time ever, he pored over an
"
2246,"engineering drawing like he really wanted to make one. he thought of other clever things, a
"
2247,"snap-up lid, a little mirror, and her name etched on top.
"
2248,"after the designing, he broke up the task into various parts; cutting, bending, buffing — all
"
2249,"concepts we found boring as hell in class were now suddenly interesting. we forgot about
"
2250,"the actual assignment for the day, as we gave a damn about our grades anyway.
"
2251,"three hours later, i etched out the last few letters of “neha cherian’ on her made-in-iit
"
2252,"lipstick box.
"
2253,"“this is pretty neat,” i said, impressed at the snap-open mechanism, “she will love this.
"
2254,"thanks, ryan.”
"
2255,"“any time man,” he raised his thumb. yes, i really wanted to be like ryan, who i loved
"
2256,"most of the time. at least i hated him less than myself.
"
2257,"i presented neha’s gift to her at our ice-cream parlour.
"
2258,"“what? what did you say this is?” she twisted the metallic cigarette box-sized case
"
2259,"round and round in her hands.
"
2260,"“tt is a lipstick holder,” i said.
"
2261,"“really? never heard of them.”
"
2262,"i asked her for her lipsticks. she had five, which meant our design was below capacity.
"
2263,"anyway, i took four — red, copper, brown and pink (why girls put coloured wax on their
"
2264,"bodies continues to be a mystery to me) and placed them inside. snug fit, snap cover — the
"
2265,"design worked perfectly. one surface had a mirror, so the user could apply the coloured
"
2266,"wax accurately and not paint their nostrils in the bargain.
"
2267,"“why lipstick case?”
"
2268,"“t don’t know. i like your lips i guess,” i said.
"
2269,"“very funny. and you made this?” she said.
"
2270,"“yes, with ryan. see, it is personalized.” i turned the box to its lower surface. “neha
"
2271,"cherian’, the most beautiful name in the world was written in the most beautiful letters.
"
2272,"“wow,” neha said softly, and then fondled the lipstick holder from the iit delhi
"
2273,"machining lab like it was a newborn baby. “wow,” she said again.
"
2274,"“what?” i said. (okay, so i was fishing for a little more appreciation here than the
"
2275,"monosyllabic ‘wow’ .)
"
2276,"“no one has done anything like this for me,” neha said.
"
2277,"and it was at this moment that by pure chance i came out with the right line. i don’t know
"
2278,"how it came to me, but it just did. “well, no one has meant more to me in life.”
"
2279,"maybe it was not completely true. but it wasn’t all lies either (and 1n any case, it is about
"
2280,"saying the right thing to girls, who gives a damn if it is true or not. i am hari, not
"
2281,"harishchandra).
"
2282,"“really?” neha asked.
"
2283,"“yes.”
"
2284,"“thanks, hari. see i am going to use it right now,” she said.
"
2285,"i watched neha’s face as she applied her lipstick with the same concentration as alok
"
2286,"had when doing quanti problems. girls are beautiful, let’s face it, and life 1s quite, quite
"
2287,"worthless without them.
"
2288,"“what time you got to go home?” i said.
"
2289,"“say by nine,” neha said. “i told them i’m meeting girlfriends for dinner.”
"
2290,"“wow, pretty liberal of them,” i said sarcastically.
"
2291,"“they know i was feeling down. thinking of samir again.”
"
2292,"“hey, you want me to take you to a secret place?” i said.
"
2293,"“where?”
"
2294,"“the insti roof.”
"
2295,"“what? are you crazy. right on top of the insti, as if there could be a worse place for
"
2296,"going public!”
"
2297,"“there 1s no one there. ryan and i have gone dozens of times. and the view from the bell
"
2298,"tower is beautiful.”
"
2299,"i could see neha was excited about the roof. it took me a few minutes of persuasion,
"
2300,"convincing her that no one would find out, as we could follow her standard ‘five minutes
"
2301,"apart’ policy to walk up there.
"
2302,"“t’ll go. but not today. it’s close to nine. how about next time, and ll cry for samir the
"
2303,"whole day so they let me go out until eleven.”
"
2304,"i didn’t really dig her idea of using her brother as a weapon to stay out late but her
"
2305,"parents were certified weirdos and probably deserved such tactics.
"
2306,"“next time meet me on the roof directly, at eight-thirty.”
"
2307,"“sure,” she said, “you said it is safe, right?”
"
2308,"“yes, trust me,” i winked.
"
2309,"10
"
2310,"cooperate to dominate
"
2311,"“here, one copy for each of you.” ryan handed out papers to us with the
"
2312,"title: the c2d plan.
"
2313,"i had forgotten about the c2d theory, but obviously ryan hadn’t. he had in fact been
"
2314,"working on the official document. we were sitting at sasi’s and alok was busy with his
"
2315,"second plate of paranthas, when ryan dished out his plan for the rest of our iit stay.
"
2316,"“whassit?” alok’s greasy fingertips left marks on the sheet, obviously needing a tissue
"
2317,"more than an iit plan. there was something about alok with his food that was too intimate
"
2318,"to be watched.
"
2319,"i read out the contents.
"
2320,"cooperate to dominate. the iit system is unfair because:
"
2321,". it suppresses talent and individual spirit.
"
2322,". it extracts the best years of one’s life from the country’s brightest minds.
"
2323,". it judges you with a draconian gp a system that destroys relationships.
"
2324,". the profs don’t care for the students.
"
2325,"_ iit s have hardly contributed to the country .
"
2326,"a bw nhn re
"
2327,"“you have the time to do all this?” was alok’s response, which was stupid because ryan
"
2328,"had all the time in the world.
"
2329,"i read on: so, the only way to take on the unfair system is through unfair means — which is
"
2330,"cooperate to dominate or c2d. and this is the plan that ryan, hari and alok agree to for
"
2331,"the rest of their stay at the insti. the key tenets are:
"
2332,"1. all assignments to be shared — one person will do each assignment by turn. the others
"
2333,"will simply copy it. saves time, saves duplication of effort.
"
2334,"2. we will divide up the course responsibilities. for instance, if there are six courses in
"
2335,"the semester, we will take care of only two each. one must attend all classes that one is
"
2336,"responsible for, but can skip all others. (note: ryan gets all prof veera courses) in each
"
2337,"class you attend for your course — take copious notes. the rest will merely copy them.
"
2338,"3. we share lab experiment observations.
"
2339,"4. our friendship is above gpas. with all the new spare time, we live our lives to the
"
2340,"fullest.
"
2341,"5. we combine our hostel rooms into one living unit — one common bedroom, one study
"
2342,"room and one fun party room.
"
2343,"6. we split the cost of vodka regardless of how many drinks each person has had.
"
2344,"ryan looked at us as if he was expecting us to break into applause. we kept silent, hoping
"
2345,"he would explain where he was going with this.
"
2346,"“so, what do you guys think?” he asked.
"
2347,"“what is this? some kind of teenage club thing?”
"
2348,"“if you agree, sign it. sign it with your blood.”
"
2349,"“yeah right,” i said, “how old are we, like twelve?”
"
2350,"“t am serious man,” ryan said and then before we could say anything, he flicked out a
"
2351,"razor blade from his pocket. in one nick, his thumb sprouted a dot of red.
"
2352,"“ryan, are you crazy?” alok squeaked, almost losing his breakfast at this gross act.
"
2353,"“no. just want to drive the point home. you decide what you want to do,” ryan said,
"
2354,"signing the document with a toothpick dipped in his blood.
"
2355,"“can we discuss this first?” i said.
"
2356,"“what is there to discuss? i am not forcing anyone.”
"
2357,"“like this whole sharing assignments and observations. isn’t that heating?” alok said.
"
2358,"i agreed with alok, though i was more concerned about the vodka costs, given that ryan
"
2359,"out-drank us ever y single time.
"
2360,"“tt is not cheating, it is cooperation. they have divided us with their gpas, we are just
"
2361,"pulling together to fight back.”
"
2362,"“t don’t see it that way,” i insisted.
"
2363,"“are you signing or not?” ryan put his hands on his hips.
"
2364,"i thought about the c2d one last time. “well. i can sign it, though i am not cutting myself
"
2365,"or anything.”
"
2366,"“tt just takes a second,” ryan said and flicked the blade on my forefinger and blood
"
2367,"spouted out of me before i could form my denial.
"
2368,"“fuck you.”
"
2369,"ryan laughed and said, “sorry man, look at your face. c’mon man, get into the spirit. just
"
2370,"sign it.”
"
2371,"i looked at ryan 1n disgust and signed the sheet.
"
2372,"alok sat there, petrified like a chicken in a butcher shop. the old alok would have
"
2373,"vociferously stood up to ryan, but the new, improved version, just back with us, did not
"
2374,"want to fight again. “i’ll make the cut myself,” he said finally.
"
2375,"and soon he did get some blood from his little finger and we signed the c2d document
"
2376,"like primitive tribesmen. i have to say, the whole blood thing made this feel important. i was
"
2377,"not sure of what i had done, but somehow it sounded exciting. we converted our three single
"
2378,"rooms into one apartment the same day. ryan’s room became the party room, alok’s was the
"
2379,"study room with three tables and my room had the three beds.
"
2380,"“so you friends moved in together,” neha said.
"
2381,"we were en route to the insti roof as per plan. she met me at eight p.m. her parents
"
2382,"blissfully ignorant about her real whereabouts, picturing her by a cake at a non-existent
"
2383,"friend’s birthday party.
"
2384,"“yes, sort of. we combined our rooms to one living unit,” i said, panting as we climbed
"
2385,"the back stairs to the building.
"
2386,"“sounds exciting,” she said, blowing the fringe out of her eye.
"
2387,"it was already dark when we reached the roof. as always, there was no one there.
"
2388,"“wow, look at all the stars,” neha said.
"
2389,"“yes,” i said, proud as if i had finger-painted the sky myself. “and it’s all ours. check out
"
2390,"the campus view. see — that’s where you live,” i pointed.
"
2391,"we couldn’t see much, apart from the lights in the living room.
"
2392,"“wow. we are so near to them, yet so far,” neha said dreamily, flopping on the concrete
"
2393,"floor. “so?”
"
2394,"“so what?” i said.
"
2395,"“where 1s the vodka? don’t you guys drink here?”
"
2396,"“yes. but you don’t drink, do you?”
"
2397,"“says who? [ll have one if you have some.”
"
2398,"“we do hide a bottle under the bell. let me look,” i said, surprised at neha’s request. she
"
2399,"was a nice girl, i thought. nice girls do not drink. but i kind of could do with a drink myself,
"
2400,"so i came back with the bottle.
"
2401,"“nice,” she said, as she lay back against the dish antenna, “look at the stars above, just so
"
2402,"beautiful. i wish i were a bird.”
"
2403,"when people want to be birds, they are normally getting drunk. but she was getting trippy
"
2404,"just from the idea of drinking on the insti roof.
"
2405,"“oh, i could lie here forever. give me another drink,” she said.
"
2406,"“don’t have too much,” i had to caution.
"
2407,"“t won't. my dad will kill me if he smells it.”
"
2408,"“of course you'll smell of it.”
"
2409,"“not much, check this out.”
"
2410,"she opened her purse. ten items later, she took out a pack of cardamom pods.
"
2411,"“see, one of these and i go home minty fresh.”
"
2412,"“really? then have one now, be minty for me.”
"
2413,"“what? do i have bad breath?” she sat up straighter.
"
2414,"“t did not say that.”
"
2415,"she held my arm and pulled me toward her. “look me in the eye and tell me if i have bad
"
2416,"breath.”
"
2417,"“t don’t know. i have never been that close to your mouth,” i said honestly, even as the
"
2418,"millimeters between our mouths lessened.
"
2419,"“go to hell,” she laughed and pushed me away.
"
2420,"“see, you are chicken. just so chicken,” i said.
"
2421,"“no, i am not. look at me, a professor’s daughter, getting drunk on the insti roof with a
"
2422,"five point something loafer.”
"
2423,"if she had not been laughing, i would have resented that, but i decided to milk the
"
2424,"opportunity anyway.
"
2425,"“loafer? so lama loafer,” i said.
"
2426,"“yes, but...”
"
2427,"“but what?”
"
2428,"“but i love my loafer,” she said and pulled me toward her again. again, our mouths were
"
2429,"millimeters away. she tilted her head sideways. was she going to kiss me? or rather, was
"
2430,"she-plus-two-glasses-of-vodka going to kiss me?
"
2431,"“we don’t need no ejju-kay-shion...” a hoarse singing voice startled us from our
"
2432,"embrace. someone had just come to the insti roof.
"
2433,"“what the...” neha said, “i thought you said no one was here.”
"
2434,"“t don’t know. shh... quiet,” i said as we tried to hide behind the antenna.
"
2435,"i finally recognized ryan’s voice through all that bad singing and saw him heading for our
"
2436,"vodka hiding place.
"
2437,"“tt’s ryan!” i said in a voice mixed with relief and irritation at losing my moment.
"
2438,"“ryan,” i shouted.
"
2439,"“hari,” he shouted back, walking over. “bastard, you are here and i was looking all over
"
2440,"for you. is there someone with you?”
"
2441,"“ryan, i want you to meet...”
"
2442,"“tt’s a girl!” ryan exclaimed as if he had spotted me with a dead rabbit. neha continued
"
2443,"to cower behind me, attempting anonymity.
"
2444,"“tt’s neha,” i said. “neha, meet ryan. ryan, be nice and say hello to neha.”
"
2445,"ryan’s voice mellowed down instantly. what is it with men; they become another person
"
2446,"in female company. so predictable!
"
2447,"“hi neha,” ryan said, trying to avoid staring too much at someone he had heard so much
"
2448,"about.
"
2449,"“hi,” neha said, still unsure if ryan could be trusted.
"
2450,"“t was just looking for hari to do an assignment,” ryan said.
"
2451,"“drop it ryan. we’re having a drink,” i said.
"
2452,"“really?” ryan said as if he expected neha to be winged and haloed or something. “but i
"
2453,"thought neha was not like that.”
"
2454,"“like what?” she asked immediately.
"
2455,"“uh, nothing,” ryan said and sat down on the warm concrete.
"
2456,"“so what have you heard about me?” neha said.
"
2457,"“lots,” ryan said and started telling her sacred details about all our past dates. they kept
"
2458,"talking for like ten hours or something and i just kept getting more drunk. ryan has a
"
2459,"computer memory or something, and he told her about the times even i had forgotten about.
"
2460,"“he told you about the family planning documentary?” neha tittered.
"
2461,"“of course, he tells me everything,” he said with considerable pride.
"
2462,"i wondered if neha and i would have kissed and managed more if bloody ryan had not
"
2463,"dragged himself up here. i considered pushing him off the insti roof, but thought 1t would
"
2464,"kind of spoil the mood anyway.
"
2465,"“so why did you say i wasn’t that type of girl?” neha said.
"
2466,"“you know, the whole vodka thing. you are supposed to be well... forget it,” ryan said.
"
2467,"“what? tell me,” neha said with a firmness only good-looking women possess.
"
2468,"“you are like this good girl. like why else won’t you let him do anything? dating for a
"
2469,"year, still no kiss even. just this goody-goody prof’s daughter.”
"
2470,"“he told you that?” neha squeaked.
"
2471,"“of course. you think you are dating a guy or someone asexual? you don’t think he has
"
2472,"needs?”
"
2473,"“shut up, ryan.” this from me.
"
2474,"“c’mon man. show some guts sometimes. this is for your own good.”
"
2475,"“needs?” neha repeated, dazed.
"
2476,"“yes, ever y man has needs. and pretty girls like you are either not aware of them or deny
"
2477,"them for power games.”
"
2478,"“power?” neha repeated.
"
2479,"i wanted to tell ryan i had just been getting somewhere nicely, thank you, when he
"
2480,"whistled by.
"
2481,"“yes, power. what else?” ryan said, calming down finally.
"
2482,"“t crave power? now that is a joke. you guys just don’t understand women do you?”
"
2483,"neha said, with a vodka-infused confidence that could take on even ryan.
"
2484,"“huh?” ryan said, proving that we really did not understand women.
"
2485,"neha had to go home soon after that, so we left the topic there. i wanted to scream at
"
2486,"ryan later, but he rolled two joints for me and gave me a scooter ride back to kumaon, so i
"
2487,"left it. besides, neha really did not seem mad or anything.
"
2488,"i had a hunch he might have helped my case!
"
2489," 
"
2490,"11
"
2491,"the gift
"
2492,"i am a horrible person on the inside and this i demonstrated while fitting in
"
2493,"alok for the morning classes, citing his practice of waking early during those venkat days,
"
2494,"laying on thickly the unreliability of ryan and me for any sunrise job.
"
2495,"c2d was great, i found out, as i was responsible for only two courses in a semester. for
"
2496,"the rest, alok and ryan gave me all the assignments (which i copied) and their notes (which
"
2497,"i photocopied). i returned the favour 1n my courses. we now needed to spend only an hour
"
2498,"or two a day in studies, leaving us with plenty of time for movies, scooter drives,
"
2499,"restaurants, chess, scrabble, indoor cricket, sleep, squash (yes, ryan was trying again) and
"
2500,"of course, booze and grass. the first minors that semester were a breeze. we didn’t like ace
"
2501,"the class or anything, but our expectations were low — just maintaining our five-point gpas.
"
2502,"it is amazing how happy one can be with low expectations of one’s self.
"
2503,"i was in the design class one day, a course for which i was responsible. ryan chose to
"
2504,"attend the class with me. i think he believes he 1s like this great designer or something. prof
"
2505,"vohra was teaching us.
"
2506,"“class, note down this problem that i want you to do in the next fifteen minutes. design a
"
2507,"car jack to lift the chassis in case of flat tires etc. do a simple sketch.”
"
2508,"prof vohra was a portly man in his fifties, who had an unusually kind face for a prof. of
"
2509,"course, nothing 1n his nature supported this. with six term papers a semester and a lethal red
"
2510,"pen that crossed out one design submission after another, kind was hardly how you’d
"
2511,"describe prof vohra.
"
2512,"it was my course, therefore my hand that had to sketch the car jack with ryan merely
"
2513,"having to copy it. prof vohra had taught us enough for us to execute at least a basic screw-
"
2514,"type design. i had just begun to draw when ryan said, “what? you are going to make the
"
2515,"same damn thing like the rest?”
"
2516,"“yes sir, i am not thomas edison,” i said, “and this is my course so just shut up and copy
"
2517,"it.”
"
2518,"“t have another idea,” ryan said.
"
2519,"i wanted to tell ryan to screw his other idea and copy my screw-jack. but i never say
"
2520,"anything to ryan, and he never listens to anyone anyway.
"
2521,"so ryan drew this ‘modified screw-jack’, in which one did not manually have to open
"
2522,"and raise the jack. a flat tire did not mean the engine had failed, he said, hence one could
"
2523,"attach a motor on the traditional jack and hook it up to the car battery. if one switched on the
"
2524,"car ignition, the motor could derive power.
"
2525,"“what are you doing?” i said, worried about ryan’s sketches of the car battery, obviously
"
2526,"irrelevant to the current task.
"
2527,"“you wait and see, the prof will love it,” ryan said.
"
2528,"i stuck to my traditional screw-jack like the rest of the class. the course was called
"
2529,"design, not original design after all.
"
2530,"prof vohra walked along the class rows, looking at the familiar designs that all his
"
2531,"students drew year after year — the simple screw-jack. his stroll ended at our desk.
"
2532,"“what is this?” prof vohra said, twisting his head around to make sense of ryan’s
"
2533,"unfamiliar drawing.
"
2534,"“sir, this is a modified screw-jack,” ryan said, “it can be attached to the car’s
"
2535,"battery...”
"
2536,"“ts this an electrical engineering class?”
"
2537,"“no sir but the end need 1s the same...”
"
2538,"“ts this an internal combustion engines class?”
"
2539,"“sir but...”
"
2540,"“if you don’t want to be in my class or follow my course, you may leave.”
"
2541,"prof vohra’s face no longer looked kind. if only ryan had kept quiet, he would have
"
2542,"moved on.
"
2543,"“sir, this is a new design,” ryan said, as if it was not painfully obvious.
"
2544,"“really? and who told you to do that?”
"
2545,"ryan did not answer, just lifted his assignment sheet. then in one stroke, he ripped it
"
2546,"apart in two pieces.
"
2547,"“there, it is useless now,” ryan said.
"
2548,"prof vohra’s face contorted and turned red, “don’t act smart in my class.”
"
2549,"“sorry sir,” i said, though it was not for me to say it.
"
2550,"but it broke the tension. the prof and ryan looked at me via the corners of their
"
2551,"respective eyes. prof vohra exhaled and moved on; ryan sat down.
"
2552,"“that wasn’t very smart. you know he can flunk you,” i said to ryan after class.
"
2553,"“t don’t care. i can’t wait to get out of this stupid place man,” he said, kicking the scooter
"
2554,"stand as 1f it was prof vohra’s face.
"
2555,"it wasn’t ryan’s course anyway and he did not attend any further classes in design. he
"
2556,"directly copied answers of my assignments mindlessly, and never as much as looked at the
"
2557,"question-sheet. yes, our greatest designer gave up.
"
2558,"the three of us were 1n our common study room one day, copying alok’s thermal science
"
2559,"assignment.
"
2560,"“so, prof vohra is mad at you now,” alok said.
"
2561,"ryan kept silent.
"
2562,"“of course he would be. you should have seen his face,” i contributed.
"
2563,"alok laughed, shaking his head.
"
2564,"“he can flunk me for all i care,” ryan stated.
"
2565,"“that 1s not the point,” alok began.
"
2566,"“fatso, you won't get the point, so give up. by the way, prof veera called me to talk
"
2567,"about my lubricant assignment.”
"
2568,"“really?” alok and i said in unison, wondering if prof veera had caught us cheating.
"
2569,"“nothing to worry guys. i gave him a separate paper. it wasn’t a class assignment.”
"
2570,"“you have time to do separate papers?” i said.
"
2571,"“t have time to do what i want. i had thoughts on doing some experiments with various
"
2572,"substance mixtures to check lubricant efficiency in a scooter engine.”
"
2573,"“where?” i said.
"
2574,"“well, ideally in the fluid mechanics lab. but then we need a scooter engine, and a small
"
2575,"budget to buy materials. until then, i tried a few tests on my scooter.”
"
2576,"“wow. you’re screwing your scooter up. how will we travel?” i said.
"
2577,"“tt is for science. i might be on to something. anyway, i combined different types of oils
"
2578,"to check mileage. i think i can beat normal lubes by ten percent.”
"
2579,"i have to say, i was impressed with ryan. against all odds, this man was working to
"
2580,"reduce our petrol bill. i thought of all the extra paranthas we could buy with a ten percent
"
2581,"lower fuel cost.
"
2582,"“so, what did prof veera call you for?” alok said.
"
2583,"“he said he’d help me get the institute’s permission to use the lab and get some research
"
2584,"grant.”
"
2585,"“wow! you will be a scholar man,” alok said.
"
2586,"“yeah whatever,” ryan shrugged, “it is not that easy. one has to submit a proposal to prof
"
2587,"cherian, detailing budgets, benefits, timing and all that crap, then a committee decides. it
"
2588,"takes months.”
"
2589,"“but if you do get it...” alok blinked rapidly, “so neat man.”
"
2590,"“t have to work hard on the proposal over the next few weeks. don’t worry, i'll do my
"
2591,"courses, but no partying or movies,” ryan said.
"
2592,"now, if alok had said the same thing, ryan would have blown a fuse. but this was ryan,
"
2593,"and we never said anything to him. besides, i was kind of glad he was into something
"
2594,"sensible.
"
2595,"“sure, we’ll tell you what you missed,” i said and winked at alok.
"
2596,"“yeah, though that makes you the mugger now,” alok said.
"
2597,"“t am not a mugger. you are the mugger, venkat-boy,” ryan retorted.
"
2598,"i have to say, it was never my thing to visit alok’s house. just the thought assailed me with
"
2599,"medicine smells, crumbling concrete and cooking smells, topped by a middle-aged woman
"
2600,"wailing at the drop of a hat. yet, there i was one saturday with alok, if only because ryan
"
2601,"was busy with his do-not-disturb-me lube research proposal. it was depressing to see ryan
"
2602,"work so hard and he did like three night-outs one week in the computer centre and the
"
2603,"library. on top of that, he spent his days in the fluid mechanics lab mixing lubes and then
"
2604,"testing them on the scooter. i told him about this movie at priya in which there were as many
"
2605,"as six topless scenes and he only looked blankly at me. i tried luring him with new cocktail
"
2606,"recipes, but ryan stuck to six straight cups of coffee a mght. objectives, scoping, budgeting,
"
2607,"applications, past research — each section in his proposal was like a million pages. he
"
2608,"submitted drafts to prof veera, who almost always wanted ryan to do more.
"
2609,"so when alok asked me to his house for lunch i found myself agreeing if only for the
"
2610,"food. i had learnt to ride now and ryan’s scooter was free that day (though ryan did give us
"
2611,"the task of noting down the kilometres back and forth).
"
2612,"delhi roads are a mghtmare and i couldn’t dream of driving as fast as ryan. alok and i
"
2613,"couldn’t go beyond fifty, and alok kept talking as i navigated the cows and the cops to the
"
2614,"suburbs.
"
2615,"“you think ryan will get the project?” alok said, sitting pillion.
"
2616,"“t think so. his proposal alone is eighty pages, which i think 1s a project in itself. and i
"
2617,"mean, it is original work.”
"
2618,"“yes, but you know he has to put a cover sheet on the proposal.”
"
2619,"“so?”
"
2620,"“the cover sheet carries the student’s name and gpa. you think they’!l fund a five-point
"
2621,"something?”
"
2622,"“why not? they’ll read the proposal and decide.”
"
2623,"“they are profs,” alok said, “and you know how they think.”
"
2624,"“prof veera is with him.”
"
2625,"“yeah, let’s see.”
"
2626,"we reached alok’s house in an hour. i kind of stopped breathing to skip the medicine
"
2627,"smells. of course, couldn’t do without oxygen forever but luckily alok’s mom laid out the
"
2628,"food soon.
"
2629,"“alok, see i have made paneer for you and your friend,” his mother said.
"
2630,"for a poor family, alok’s family ate quite well. i mean, there was rice, rotis, daal, gobi-
"
2631,"aloo, mango chutney, raita and of course, matar-paneer. | guess that explained the
"
2632,"corpulence running 1n the family.
"
2633,"“eat beta, eat. don’t be shy,” alok’s mother egged me on.
"
2634,"the food was delicious but the conversation tasteless. alok’s mother recounted her last
"
2635,"week, which was full of problems. the funny thing was almost all her problems had one
"
2636,"solution — more money. on monday, the five-time-repaired geyser had broken down and
"
2637,"there was no money for a new one. on wednesday, the tv antenna took a toss and a new
"
2638,"one was too expensive. the family had to live with grainy reception until they could save
"
2639,"some money. on friday, alok’s father fell off the bed, which required a doctor to come
"
2640,"home, another hundred bucks. there were other stories too — the ration shop had started
"
2641,"charging double for sugar, and the maid had ditched twice that week.
"
2642,"“ma, can you stop boring my friend,” alok said.
"
2643,"“no, it’s fine,” i said, reaching for more daal. actually, the life alok’s mother led at
"
2644,"home intrigued me. somehow, her clutching her sari to wipe her tears had been the only
"
2645,"image i had been stuck with for the past year but now i realized she had a life too. the
"
2646,"challenges she faced were not quite lube research proposals, but pricey tomatoes
"
2647,"nonetheless.
"
2648,"“and you know the sofa springs are coming out...” she was saying when alok interrupted
"
2649,"her.
"
2650,"“mom, can you please keep quiet. i have come home after a month and that is all you have
"
2651,"to tell me.”
"
2652,"she looked surprised. “who else will i tell my problems to? i have only one son.”
"
2653,"“enough mom,” alok said, his face turning red like an expensive tomato.
"
2654,"“t will keep quiet,” alok’s mom agreed and started mumbling to herself as she ate her
"
2655,"food, “earn for them, then work like a servant for them and then they don’t even want to
"
2656,"listen to you. physics teacher mrs sharma tells me, these days sons forget their parents.”
"
2657,"clang, alok threw his plate on the floor. bits of lunch splattered all across the living
"
2658,"room and he got up and left the room.
"
2659,"what was i supposed to do? follow my friend, who had brought me here? or sit and
"
2660,"watch alok’s mother wipe her tears with her sari? i decided to do none of the above,
"
2661,"focusing on the matar-paneer. the food was good, that 1s what i came here for, i kept telling
"
2662,"myself, looking intently at the plate.
"
2663,"needless to say, it wasn’t a happy visit home. alok kind of cooled down, came back to
"
2664,"the living room, and sat on the sofa. alok’s mother cried her stock of tears, and went in to
"
2665,"get kheer.
"
2666,"“alok, what are you doing man?”
"
2667,"“you stay out of this hari. you won’t understand.”
"
2668,"yeah right, i should stay out of this, i thought. but he was the one who had got me into
"
2669,"this.
"
2670,"“she has made kheer and everything. what 1s your problem?”
"
2671,"“they are my problem. you won’t understand, shut up and wait for the kheer.”
"
2672,"we did wait for the kheer, which was perfect. i was sure that alok’s family could solve
"
2673,"half their problems if they stuck to a more frugal diet but good food seemed vital to them,
"
2674,"even at the cost of tv reception. it was their situation, so i stayed out of it until we were on
"
2675,"our way back.
"
2676,"“t know what you are thinking,” alok said.
"
2677,"“what?”
"
2678,"“that how can i be so heartless.”
"
2679,"the only thing i had thought about alok’s heart was that it would be under tremendous
"
2680,"strain with such a fat-intensive diet.
"
2681,"“nah, just haven’t seen you like that,’ i said as i turned on the munirka crossing,
"
2682,"narrowly avoiding a peanut seller.
"
2683,"“that is all they talk to me about; problems, problems and more problems,” alok said,
"
2684,"“and what can i bloody do about them?”
"
2685,"“hmmm. that is true,” i said, wondering if alok was now telling me a problem i couldn’t
"
2686,"do anything about.
"
2687,"vivas — the most hated, dreaded moments of my student life. i avoided them like i did cows
"
2688,"on the road with their tails twitched up. but like the cattle in delhi traffic, sometimes you
"
2689,"just couldn’t avoid running into them. and this one wednesday was the design viva. it was
"
2690,"my course under the c2d, and i was supposed to take the lead on all questions. i tried to
"
2691,"convince ryan and alok to help me, but the bastards didn’t care and had gone to sleep at ten
"
2692,"the previous night, leaving me to mug through the night and prepare for all expected
"
2693,"questions. it wasn’t much use, for in my case it wasn’t about knowing the answers.
"
2694,"“hari, what makes c40 steel better than c20 steel for making rigid structures?”
"
2695,"more carbon in c40, hence harder steel, i thought. also, probably cheaper in terms of
"
2696,"costs. c20 was soft and could buckle. i knew the answer... if only prof vohra would stop
"
2697,"looking me in the eye.
"
2698,"“sir, c40 steel is...” i said as i looked back at ryan and alok to evoke some pity.
"
2699,"“look at me hari,” prof vohra said, “i am asking you.”
"
2700,"i didn’t want to look at him, and i really wanted to get the answer out. but all i got out
"
2701,"was fat drops of sweat, on my face, arms and hands.
"
2702,"four tries and three different questions later, prof vohra gave up. ryan shook his head
"
2703,"and smiled, as if he’d known all along that this would happen. alok kept quiet, as he
"
2704,"mentally calculated how many marks we had lost.
"
2705,"“sorry guys,” i said at dinner, “i let you down again. i hate vivas man.”
"
2706,"the mess workers tossed rotis that you could make jeans out of; i tore one hard, hoping to
"
2707,"relieve my tension.
"
2708,"“what happens to you?” alok said.
"
2709,"“t don’t know. whenever someone asks me a question in a stressful situation, i can’t say
"
2710,"anything,”
"
2711,"“since when?” alok said.
"
2712,"“since high school,” i said.
"
2713,"“something happened?” ryan said.
"
2714,"“no... mean yeah, nothing,” i said.
"
2715,"“what?” alok said.
"
2716,"“forget it. pass the rice, i can’t digest these rotis. they are like chewing gum,” i said.
"
2717,"neha’s birthday was on december 1 and as usual i was clueless about what to get her.
"
2718,"“you have to make it special,” ryan said. we were skipping class and having lunch in the
"
2719,"canteen.
"
2720,"“special how? i have no cash. i can’t even afford toothpaste right now,” i said.
"
2721,"“you are not brushing your teeth?” alok said, looking up.
"
2722,"“no man i’m using ryan’s,” i said. “anyway, come to the point fatso, what should i do?”
"
2723,"“think,” ryan said, knocking his head like he was solving a nuclear physics problem. he
"
2724,"is a patronizing bastard, i tell you.
"
2725,"“t can’t think of anything,” i said. “no more ‘make-your-own-gifts’, did that with the
"
2726,"lipstick box already, so it won’t have the same effect. and i am so broke, i can’t give her
"
2727,"something expensive.”
"
2728,"“how about something useful but cheap, like handkerchiefs?” alok said.
"
2729,"“shut up alok,” ryan said.
"
2730,"i was glad he said it for me. alok had as much of an idea of romantic gifts as his mother
"
2731,"had about cabarets.
"
2732,"“ryan, what should i do?” i was panicking.
"
2733,"“well, it doesn’t have to be expensive, as long as it’s a surprise. who doesn’t like
"
2734,"surprises?”
"
2735,"“like what?” i said.
"
2736,"“like being the first one to wish her,” ryan said.
"
2737,"ryan’s plan was quite original (and cheap); to break into her room, right through her
"
2738,"window on the eve of her birthday. at midnight, i would be the first one to wish her and the
"
2739,"surprise would sweep her off her feet (and hence eliminate the need for a real gift). it was a
"
2740,"crazy idea, for we weren’t just breaking into my girlfriend’s house, but a prof ’s house, that
"
2741,"too a head of the department no less. but ryan made it seem easier than copying a
"
2742,"thermodynamics assignment, and i agreed.
"
2743,"so, at eleven-thirty p.m. on a cold december night, ryan, alok and i quietly slipped out
"
2744,"of kumaon. ryan drove us to the faculty housing complex and parked his scooter fifty
"
2745,"meters from neha’s house. the entire lane was silent in contrast with kumaon where the
"
2746,"assignments and mugging had only just begun for the night. the profs slept blissfully, while
"
2747,"their minions worked away through the night.
"
2748,"“ryan, you sure we can handle this?” i asked one last time as we neared the lawns of
"
2749,"prof cherian’s house.
"
2750,"“shhh... of course, we can, but if only you keep quiet,” ryan said as he lifted the latch off
"
2751,"cherian’s gate.
"
2752,"silence, apart from a gentle creaking of the gate as we entered the den of the beauty and
"
2753,"the beast.
"
2754,"i looked up at neha’s window, imagining her sleeping peacefully, her beautiful face
"
2755,"glowing in the dark. my heart quickened.
"
2756,"“alok, come on you go first. on the pipe now,” ryan whispered.
"
2757,"“this 1s impossible,” alok said.
"
2758,"“t’ll give you a push,” ryan said.
"
2759,"as he climbed up the flimsy steel pipe, he looked like a gorilla hanging onto a bamboo
"
2760,"stick. there was serious risk of the pipe breaking, given his mass and the strength of
"
2761,"galvanized steel (see, our engineering knowledge did amount to something), so we decided
"
2762,"to wait until he reached the roof.
"
2763,"after alok it was my turn, followed by ryan, who shimmied up the pipe in seconds. ten
"
2764,"minutes to midnight, we were on prof cherian’s roof.
"
2765,"it was pitch dark. ryan finally switched on a flashlight and we tried to navigate through
"
2766,"the water tanks and clothes left to dry on the roof.
"
2767,"“where 1s her room?” ryan whispered.
"
2768,"i pointed mutely and we moved toward the ledge.
"
2769,"“here are the flowers,” ryan said as he pulled out a bunch of sunflowers from under his
"
2770,"shirt.
"
2771,"“where did you get these?” i said.
"
2772,"“just now, from cherian’s garden.”
"
2773,"“are you crazy?” i said.
"
2774,"“nice touch,” ryan said, “now get ready.”
"
2775,"we knocked on neha’s window using some pebbles from the roof. nothing happened at
"
2776,"the first pebble, nothing on the second and third.
"
2777,"“it’s not working, she probably sleeps too deeply,” alok said.
"
2778,"“keep trying,” ryan said.
"
2779,"we kept throwing little pebbles like morons. probably a million pebbles later, we had a
"
2780,"reaction. the room light switched on, and the window became bright.
"
2781,"climbing up a pipe was hard enough, but the next step was the real killer. i was supposed
"
2782,"to dangle myself over the ledge, with alok and ryan holding my hands for emergency
"
2783,"support. but first neha had to open the window.
"
2784,"“quick, say her name before she screams in fear,” ryan said.
"
2785,"“neha, it’s me,” i said, not whispering for the first time in half an hour.
"
2786,"“hari,” neha said as she opened her window, “what are you doing here?”
"
2787,"“t can explain. let me come in first,” i said, and sprung myself over.
"
2788,"“are you crazy?” she said and rubbed her eyes even as my legs dangled in front of her
"
2789,"face.
"
2790,"“careful ryan,” i said.
"
2791,"“who else is there?” neha said, by now completely awake and completely in shock.
"
2792,"“no one... i mean only ryan and alok,” i said as i swung myself inside the window.
"
2793,"“careful,” she said as i landed on some cushions on a rug, pretty and delicate as only ina
"
2794,"girl’s room.
"
2795,"i gave a thumbs-up signal to my friends and banged shut the window.
"
2796,"“hari, what exactly do you think you are doing?” neha said, “what if dad wakes up?”
"
2797,"she adjusted her hair as i noticed her nightclothes. she wore a sleeveless, simple cotton
"
2798,"nightie with little blue triangles all over. as always, she looked beautiful.
"
2799,"“happy birthday, neha,” i said, and took the flowers out from under my shirt.
"
2800,"the flowers were crushed and already wilted, but there is something about flowers and
"
2801,"women. somehow, seeing these reproductive tools of plant-life works wonders. it chills
"
2802,"them out. neha’s anger vanished, and i could tell the idea had worked.
"
2803,"“sunflowers,” neha said, “where did you get these?”
"
2804,"“from your garden actually.”
"
2805,"“what?” neha said and threw a stem at me, “you loafer. such a cheapo you are.”
"
2806,"i took a cushion 1n response and threw it back at her. i was just getting excited about the
"
2807,"impending flower and pillow fight when she nipped it in the bud.
"
2808,"“don’t mess with these cushions, i hand-painted the covers.”
"
2809,"hand-painting cushion covers, how can girls waste their time on such useless pursuits? i
"
2810,"mean, ryan and i didn’t even have cushion covers, let alone painted ones.
"
2811,"“what are you thinking?” neha said as she came close and held my hand.
"
2812,"“nothing. and i’m sorry i startled you like that.”
"
2813,"“tt’s okay, i like it,” neha said, “i guess it is kind of special. come sit.”
"
2814,"she made me to sit on her bed. i sat down as close to her as possible, my eyes drifting
"
2815,"down to her chest. girls don’t wear bras at night i guess, which quite obviously suits them
"
2816,"better. at the same time, i thought of the possibility of prof cherian walking in through the
"
2817,"door.
"
2818,"“what are you thinking? look into my eyes,” neha said.
"
2819,"“huh... nothing. happy birthday,” i said.
"
2820,"“aren’t you going to kiss me?”
"
2821,"my eyes went wide as ufo saucers.
"
2822,"she drew back. “wait a minute. you want to, right?”
"
2823,"“yes, of course.”
"
2824,"“so now?” she said.
"
2825,"“now what?” i said.
"
2826,"“are you going to kiss me or what?”
"
2827,"maybe it was the flowers, or just the whole excitement of breaking in, or maybe even that
"
2828,"she had finally grown up. i moved forward, and even though i had seen a million kisses in
"
2829,"movies, i can’t tell you how hard it is to deliver a good one the first time.
"
2830,"“oops... not so hard,” she said, “gentle, baby kisses first.”
"
2831,"she led the path from there, and frankly, i was too excited and scared to do better. but i
"
2832,"had my first kiss, right there in prof cherian’s house.
"
2833,"“shh... daddy’s got up for water,” she said, pushing me away.
"
2834,"“now what?”
"
2835,"“nothing, he won’t come up. but you should go now.”
"
2836,"“t want to stay.”
"
2837,"“just go now,” she said as she pushed me off the bed, in contrast to her loving looks
"
2838,"moments ago.
"
2839,"it was pointless to insist. besides, a part of me wanted to get the hell out of there before
"
2840,"the gig was up.
"
2841,"“so, how was it?” ryan said as i was pulled back on the roof.
"
2842,"“nice. very nice,” i said with a big grin splitting my face which said it all.
"
2843,"getting down was as much an art as climbing up, but the real problem was as we reached
"
2844,"the lawns. someone had switched on the living room light.
"
2845,"“how did the light go on?” alok said.
"
2846,"“don’t know. i think cherian woke up for water,” i said.
"
2847,"“let’s crawl out,” ryan said as we bent under the window to be out of sight.
"
2848,"a bucket fell noisily as alok crawled through the grass, loud enough to make all our
"
2849,"whispers pointless.
"
2850,"“who is it?” a male voice came from inside as we heard footsteps.
"
2851,"“fuck, it’s cherian. run, get the hell out of here,” ryan said.
"
2852,"we stopped with the slithery crawl and ran for our lives. if cherian had seen us, he
"
2853,"would have kicked our butts out of the college right then.
"
2854,"we were just outside the gates when the door opened and cherian came out in what
"
2855,"looked like his wife’s nightgown.
"
2856,"“who is it?” he shouted, adjusting his spectacles.
"
2857,"“your father,” ryan yelled as we ran away from the house.
"
2858,"i don’t know if cherian chased us or was too scared to do so but the three of us did not
"
2859,"stop running until we reached ryan’s scooter.
"
2860,"“are you stupid or what? why did you say that?” i reproved as we rode off.
"
2861,"“yeah, right. i should have said, sir, it’s only your son-in-law with some friends. he
"
2862,"would’ ve brought the drinks out then.”
"
2863,"12
"
2864,"neha speaks
"
2865,"samir bhaiyya,
"
2866,"i don't know how and when you will read this, this letter that i’ve got to write anyway.
"
2867,"iam always composing replies to that last mail of yours, the one you penned only to me
"
2868,"though i am not happy about the exclusivity. but then i have told you that before.
"
2869,"anyway, let me tell you about this boy i met. you could call hari my boyfriend, though
"
2870,"i dont. he is a student, can you believe it? remember how we hated every it student
"
2871,"who lived on campus? we met in this totally strange manner, there was something about
"
2872,"him that drew me from the very beginning.
"
2873,"not very good looking or anything, nor super smart but there he was, this silly
"
2874,"bumbler. as you can guess, dad and mom have no clue, something that i’ve learnt to live
"
2875,"with since you left but you can well imagine what will happen if dad finds out. remember
"
2876,"how he called cops to arrest a man who whistled at me at the campus bus stop? and the
"
2877,"time he changed the home phone number because a male classmate called for notes? he
"
2878,"wants to bring up his daughter right. i am his mission in life. he doesn’t want to make the
"
2879,"same mistake twice. did you have to do that to me, bhaiyya?
"
2880,"i just want to tell you, dont worry about me for i know girls should be good.
"
2881,"sometimes i feel this guy is only interested in getting physical. other girls who have
"
2882,"boyfriends tell me all boys are the same, want the same thing. but can i tell you
"
2883,"something? even i want the same. no, no i havent done anything yet. but then, every
"
2884,"now and then i get curious, start imagining what hari would do if i let him. is thinking
"
2885,"that a bad thing?
"
2886,"oh no, here i go, throwing questions at you again. let me tell you more about hari. he
"
2887,"has two friends - ryan and alok. they are nuts. now don't think i have started liking ht
"
2888,"students or anything — just that these guys are different. for one, they can barely remain
"
2889,"students with their five-point something gpas.
"
2890,"i know what you are thinking, they are the kind of students dad would hate, and you
"
2891,"are thinking she is hobnobbing with them for precisely that reason. you are wrong,
"
2892,"bhaiyya. you know on my last birthday, they broke into our house, these loafers i am
"
2893,"talking about. hari came into my room and gave me flowers plucked from our garden! i
"
2894,"hope dad never finds out about him the wrong way. and i hope i can keep meeting him
"
2895,"forever. though there is so much more i dont yet know about hari.
"
2896,"my plan is the day hari gets a job, i will introduce him to dad. i mean, dad will still
"
2897,"flip his lid, but at least there would be something going for hari. right now, he is a little
"
2898,"bit of a loser if you ask me. sorry, if i am being mean. but in some ways, he is. for one
"
2899,"thing, he is besotted with ryan. “ryan this, ryan that,” bugs me no end sometimes. i
"
2900,"dont think this ryan guy is all that cool. wears branded clothes, but that is only because
"
2901,"his parents are loaded. i personally think behind all this guys aggression there is a
"
2902,"vacuum.
"
2903,"see, that is the thing with these iit guys and their college, they all are too wrapped up
"
2904,"in the bricks and walls to know who they really are and what they really want. i want to
"
2905,"tell them — before you get all gung-ho about working for the future, work out your past
"
2906,"and present but that will just sound so grandma-ish and i am, well, so young.
"
2907,"well, that is all i shall write for now. i promise to write again, and i promise to be
"
2908,"good. but do not tell dad and mom what i’ve been babbling about. see, i kept your last
"
2909,"promise and have not told anyone about your letter to me how much ever that broke me,
"
2910,"so keep mine. yes, i know mom would not have been able to take it. she hardly speaks
"
2911,"these days anyway. why did you leave us bhaiyya? it isn't fair, you know that, right?
"
2912,"missing you,

"
2915,"one more year later
"
2916,"we were drinking on the insti roof. third year students now, alcohol no
"
2917,"longer a novelty. this meant we could drink less and not throw up every time to certify
"
2918,"having a good time. we were drowning our sorrows today for two reasons. firstly, after a
"
2919,"year of working the files, the mechanical engineering department had coolly rejected ryan’s
"
2920,"lube project proposal. secondly, i had messed up yet another viva. when it came to
"
2921,"screwing vivas, i am the man you want!
"
2922,"“screw the lube project. i have wasted too much time on it. but look at you, har1. it is so
"
2923,"bloody typical of you. why do you get so tongue-tied?” ryan said, in whose veins
"
2924,"confidence corpuscles flowed larger than red.
"
2925,"“t wish i knew.” i squinted, frustrated.
"
2926,"“you know the answer to the viva questions. you know the answers, right?” that was
"
2927,"alok.
"
2928,"i nodded my head. it was pointless. three years of practice in vivas did not leave me any
"
2929,"less petrified.
"
2930,"“ryan, you know i hate vivas. but c’mon man. you must feel like crap,” i said.
"
2931,"“what crap? i only did ten night outs on the proposal, the revised proposal and spent like
"
2932,"a hundred hours in the lab. but in the end, cherian shot it down. ‘too optimistic and
"
2933,"fantastic,’ he said. i could wring his bloody neck,” ryan announced.
"
2934,"“but you know your idea 1s good,” alok said flatly.
"
2935,"“of course it is. even prof veera thinks so. but cherian doesn’t, and he is the head.
"
2936,"anyway, screw it.”
"
2937,"“is it completely over?” i said.
"
2938,"“from my side. prof veera might try private sponsorship or something. pretty much over
"
2939,"though i should say,” ryan said.
"
2940,"alok sat quietly, picking his nose and sipping his vodka. it was disgusting, but it didn’t
"
2941,"bother me anymore. it is amazing how habit immunizes you.
"
2942,"i looked fully at alok. “at least you are happy.”
"
2943,"“happy?” alok echoed, “good joke.”
"
2944,"“now what happened?” i said.
"
2945,"“nothing. nothing bloody happens 1n my life situation. that is why i am never happy.
"
2946,"sister needs to get married, that is the latest i guess.”
"
2947,"alok had a point. a miserable home, pointless grades and loser friends was hardly the
"
2948,"route to happiness. at least he had the joy of picking dirt out of his nose in the company of
"
2949,"his friends.
"
2950,"“how’s neha?” alok said.
"
2951,"“she’s fine. that is the only thing that keeps me in iit,” i said.
"
2952,"“yeah right. have you gotten any further though?” ryan said.
"
2953,"“like what? i have kissed her now you know,” i said.
"
2954,"“yes, but like ten years ago. and there is much more than that. you know that right? or do
"
2955,"you get tongue-tied in front of her as well.”
"
2956,"alok tittered.
"
2957,"“screw you ryan,” i said, “neha is not that type of girl.”
"
2958,"“but you are that type of boy. so make her that way,” he said.
"
2959,"“how?”
"
2960,"“t can’t tell you everything.”
"
2961,"once it was dark we decided to return to kumaon. time did go on, and thank god for that.
"
2962,"for that meant we only had so many fewer days left in this place.
"
2963,"“t’ll be happy when college is over,” i said.
"
2964,"“at least we have perfected the c2d,” alok said.
"
2965,"“of course,” ryan said and smirked, “when was the last time each of us did his own
"
2966,"assignment?”
"
2967,"“tt still scares me sometimes though,” i said.
"
2968,"“why? the profs never read the crap they give us carefully. they’il never find out,” ryan
"
2969,"dismissed, cocky as ever.
"
2970,"“t heard cherian is anal though,” alok said.
"
2971,"we’d find out soon; it was finally time for cherian to start teaching industrial engineering
"
2972,"and management or indem.
"
2973,"“yes, the bastard will teach us finally. i am not attending any of his classes,” ryan said.
"
2974,"“you don’t have to. it’s hari’s course under c2d,” alok said and winked, “our guy wants
"
2975,"to impress the dad.”
"
2976,"“well, at some point i do want neha to tell her dad about me. wouldn’t be a good start if
"
2977,"i skip all his classes,” i said.
"
2978,"“t hate him,” ryan said simply.
"
2979,"no one skipped cherian’s first class. that is, no one apart from ryan. i was curious to see
"
2980,"in person the devil who tormented my girlfriend and my best friend. others went to see the
"
2981,"head of the mechanical engineering department of the best engineering college in the
"
2982,"country. they said cherian was a perfect 10 in his iit student days. i didn’t know much
"
2983,"about the man, apart from the fact that his daughter was a perfect 10 to me.
"
2984,"i had reached five minutes early, and for the first time in three years, had taken a seat in
"
2985,"the first row. i don’t know why, but i really wanted to do well in his course. perhaps an a in
"
2986,"indem might give a good first impression, leading the way for neha to introduce me. it just
"
2987,"sounded better — “dad, meet hari — the guy who topped your indem course,” rather than
"
2988,"“dad, meet hari. the loser who scraped a c in your course.”
"
2989,"prof cherian walked in precisely at nine, and brought with him a huge pile of books as if
"
2990,"he had just robbed a library.
"
2991,"“pay attention everyone. let us start with the lecture,” he began in a firm voice.
"
2992,"there 1s something about seeing your girlfriend’s parent for the first time. i couldn’t help
"
2993,"but notice how cherian was an extremely bad replica of neha. like her wax statue had
"
2994,"puffed up first and then begun to melt haphazardly. he had the same jaw and round face like
"
2995,"hers, however, his face was twice as big, with chunks of loose flesh hanging where neha
"
2996,"had these super-smooth, taut cheeks. instead of neha’s long and beautiful hair, cherian had a
"
2997,"bald spot bigger than a nirula’s hamburger. if she dressed to act in a horror movie, neha
"
2998,"would look like her father.
"
2999,"“time and motion studies are the essence of indem. as engineers you should be able to
"
3000,"reduce human actions to measurable tasks and stop talking there in the third row,” cherian
"
3001,"said as he threw a piece of chalk at two students who had found a private joke too good to
"
3002,"resist sharing it in class.
"
3003,"“meet your father-in-law,” alok whispered.
"
3004,"“looks like he can eat me alive,” i said.
"
3005,"cherian heard the whispers and stopped writing on the board. he turned around and
"
3006,"banged a duster on the table. “no one talks for the next sixty minutes,” he pronounced in a
"
3007,"no-nonsense tone that would make saddam hussein shudder, “is that clear?”
"
3008,"chalk dust formed a cloud as if cherian had burst a grenade in the classroom. behind
"
3009,"this, one could barely see his contorted face. i wondered how neha had spent an entire life
"
3010,"living with him, wanting to rescue her that very instant. i thought of eloping with her, making
"
3011,"the escape through the roof while cherian slept. but where would i take her? the hostel
"
3012,"was hardly handy, what with all of us sleeping 1n one room.
"
3013,"cherian’s first example of time and motion study was of a shirt factory. let us say there
"
3014,"were five workers, now they could either make individual shirts each, or one could divide
"
3015,"the shirt making tasks. for instance, the first worker could cut the cloth, the second worker
"
3016,"put in the first stitch, the third sews buttons and so on and so forth.
"
3017,"“this breakdown of tasks is called an assembly line. but you have to ensure that each
"
3018,"task is of equal time to avoid bottlenecks.”
"
3019,"therefore, if cutting cloth took six minutes and the first stitch took three, two workers
"
3020,"could do the first job. “this way, you can have a fast assembly line. workers focus and get
"
3021,"more skilled at their tasks. and what is more, you don’t need extra equipment — like instead
"
3022,"of five scissors, you need only one,” cherian said.
"
3023,"it all sounded very reasonable. after all, that is what engineers should do right? tell
"
3024,"workers how to work more efficiently, thinking up clever ways to save resources.
"
3025,"“he makes sense,” i said.
"
3026,"“just take notes. anything can come in the quiz,” alok said.
"
3027,"the fatso will remain a loser, i thought, except at nose, where his pickings were rich. i
"
3028,"mean, i am no great thinker or anything, but sometimes one does listen in class. all this guy
"
3029,"wanted to do was mug in class and puke in tests. i thought of discussing indem with ryan.
"
3030,"sixty minutes later, cherian put his chalk down. he modified the shirt example ten times,
"
3031,"to show various time and resource allocation combinations. in typical iit fashion, the
"
3032,"simple example somehow converted into complex equations. the prof gave an assignment
"
3033,"for the next class using these equations, which meant two hours at least in the library that
"
3034,"night.
"
3035,"“are you stupid. you found this indem crap interesting,” ryan said as i told him about the
"
3036,"class.
"
3037,"“why? think about it, instead of each person cutting and then sewing...”
"
3038,"“so, you want to reduce each tailor to a cloth cutter or button sewer. what are they,
"
3039,"bloody robots?”
"
3040,"“no, just being smart. see if you apply the optimization equation...”
"
3041,"“screw the equation. what do you want the worker to say at home? that i made ten shirts
"
3042,"today? or that i cut fifty pieces of cloth? do you realize how mind-numbing each job willl
"
3043,"become?”
"
3044,"“that is silly,” i said, “it is about improved efficiency.”
"
3045,"“but what if each worker wants to make his own shirt and wants to improve the design? it
"
3046,"is just the same cherian crap, treat humans like mindless machines.”
"
3047,"“t think you should attend his class, ryan. i can’t explain it. he seemed to make sense.”
"
3048,"“of course, he makes sense to you. you want to nail his daughter that’s why.”
"
3049,"“aw, shut up, just come to class all right. it is high time you give this system a chance.”
"
3050,"“it’s a screwed up system, so no more chances. now, give me the assignment so i can cog
"
3051,"it.”
"
3052,"i met neha outside the insti gate for a walk-date. a walk-date 1s where you go with your
"
3053,"girlfriend for a long walk to get some fresh air and quality conversation, or at least you say
"
3054,"so. the real great thing about walk-dates is that they are free. to me, nearly broke as it was
"
3055,"my turn to fill ryan’s scooter tank last time, it was the obvious choice. neha chose the route,
"
3056,"a five-kilometer return trip from the campus via nearby villages.
"
3057,"“so, tell me. what did you think of my dad?” neha said as if she expected me to jump in
"
3058,"excitement.
"
3059,"“don’t really know him, but pretty strict i think. how do you live with him?”
"
3060,"“you know he is really impressed by good students. i hope you are going to do well in his
"
3061,"course.”
"
3062,"“t am trying. but i have never got an a. and he gives like a dozen assignments a week.
"
3063,"plus there 1s a viva component that i hate.”
"
3064,"“tf you do get an a, i’ll probably tell him that we are friends.”
"
3065,"“well, iam trying. anyway, where are we walking to?”
"
3066,"“just keep walking, i have a place 1n mind.”
"
3067,"i kept silent, hoping she had thought of a secluded place. that 1s all one wants when one
"
3068,"is dating, an empty place with nothing to do, no one around. yet, you see dozens of fast-food
"
3069,"places, cinemas, and ice-cream parlours, all targeting the dating crowd. why don’t they just
"
3070,"make rows and rows of empty rooms instead?
"
3071,"neha took me through a mud-path that led to katwaria village. a few semi-naked kids
"
3072,"looked at us curiously as if we were a different species. two buffaloes loose from their
"
3073,"sheds were also taking an evening walk, and one seemed to follow us.
"
3074,"“are you sure you know where we are going?” i asked doubtfully.
"
3075,"“of course, iam. see that temple at the end of this path, over there.”
"
3076,"i squinted my eyes. there was a temple flag, around a kilometre away. after a while, the
"
3077,"buffalo following us gave up on the idea, and the two of us were alone.
"
3078,"we reached the temple and sat down at the parapet of the neglected steps. a stray
"
3079,"snoozing dog opened an eye to look at us. in front of the temple was a railway line. i
"
3080,"guessed it was for the delhi ring railway, the local city train that no one really used and ran
"
3081,"only once every couple of hours.
"
3082,"“what is this temple doing in the middle of nowhere?” i said, casually picking up her
"
3083,"hand. the dog didn’t care, and no one else was really around.
"
3084,"“t think only some villagers use it on special days. but i like it here,” neha said, leaning
"
3085,"against me.
"
3086,"we kissed, i don’t really know who started it. that is the cool thing about having a steady
"
3087,"girlfriend. you don’t have to struggle every time you want to kiss. but that was the farthest
"
3088,"you could go with neha. i put my hand on her shoulder for support. then 1n a completely
"
3089,"planned but seemingly unintentional manner i let it slip down toward her chest. maybe this
"
3090,"time her reflexes wouldn’t be as strong.
"
3091,"“no!” neha said the moment it got interesting. she pushed me away and sat up.
"
3092,"“you are so beautiful,” i said, trying to be as mellow as possible.
"
3093,"“shut up,” she said and giggled, “your corny lines aren’t going to get you anywhere. have
"
3094,"some shame, we are near a temple.”
"
3095,"yeah right, i thought. as if kissing next to a temple was okay but somehow the classic
"
3096,"“slide the hand carelessly down’ was not. neha, i tell you, is the queen of contradictions.
"
3097,"i tried to get close to her again, it was useless to argue.
"
3098,"“just kisses. you know this 1s wrong,” she warned.
"
3099,"we did our making out, or rather me-trying-to-make-out routine for half an hour, after
"
3100,"which she had to go home or something. we stood up, threw the dog a last glance and started
"
3101,"walking back.
"
3102,"“do you know my brother died on those tracks?” she said.
"
3103,"i hadn’t really heard much about how her brother died. gory stories kind of just put me
"
3104,"off but i guess guys have to listen to their girlfriends. “really? no, i didn’t know. how did
"
3105,"it happen?”
"
3106,"“t still remember the date, may 11. bhaiyya had gone for a jog. we got the call mid-
"
3107,"morning. i mean, dad got the call. he told us only in the evening and i ... wasn’t even
"
3108,"allowed to go see the body.” her voice began to quiver.
"
3109,"we were nearing the village, so i wasn’t sure if i should let her cry on my shoulder. but
"
3110,"she herself chose to, and i couldn’t do much.
"
3111,"“neha, it’s okay,” i said, conscious of two urchins staring at us. the only time they had
"
3112,"probably seen a guy and a girl embrace was on screen.
"
3113,"she only moved away from me when the number of kids watching us had gone up to eight.
"
3114,"“wow, now where did they come from?” she wiped her eyes. the eight kids, mostly
"
3115,"naked, looked at us intently as if they were watching a film.
"
3116,"“see, she is a heroine,” i said to the kids.
"
3117,"“raveena tandon,” said a three-year old in the crowd.
"
3118,"neha started to laugh, much to my relief, given her moods tended to be long.
"
3119,"we walked further, until we came close enough to campus where we adopted separate
"
3120,"paths.
"
3121,"“perhaps i can introduce you as his course topper to him some day.” she winked, walking
"
3122,"ahead.
"
3123,"i waited the prescribed five minutes and then headed for campus. was i in love with her?
"
3124,"i kicked a pebble out of my way; if only she wouldn’t be so good all the time!
"
3125," 
"
3126,"14
"
3127,"vodka
"
3128,"alok returned hyper-harried from home.
"
3129,"“how are your dad and mom?” i asked, alerted by his unusual silence at sasi’s, not even
"
3130,"asking what the daily specials were.
"
3131,"“miserable as usual. there was another big drama at home last weekend. there’s yet
"
3132,"another suitable match for my sister but we can’t cough up the suitable money. hence, either
"
3133,"we say no or sign ious, meaning give it later when i pass out of the insti, get a job and then
"
3134,"pay for it.”
"
3135,"“that’s tough,” ryan noted, who had just joined us after waking up from his royal siesta.
"
3136,"“but it is my duty man and i love them. i don’t see it as trouble,” alok said dully.
"
3137,"“so what job are you going to take up?” i said.
"
3138,"“whichever pays the most, i don’t care,” alok said.
"
3139,"“that is crap. don’t you want to do something you really like?”
"
3140,"“t like money,” alok said as he finished his food. until he had the money, paranthas
"
3141,"would do.
"
3142,"we were mid-way through the semester now, and every now and then i would start
"
3143,"thinking about my goal — to do well in indem. by third year, ever y iitian knows his place.
"
3144,"we were now five-pointers frozen in our place; we had modest expectations, and our grades
"
3145,"never disappointed us. however, 1n indem i wanted an a, something that had never been on
"
3146,"my grade sheet. alok warned me about my lofty ambition. “cherian will chew you alive
"
3147,"man. you hardly sleep these days. you know he gives only two or three as, right?”
"
3148,"“i do. but i have to give it my best. it is not just a stupid grade, but neha at stake.”
"
3149,"“how much have you scored so far in the assignments?”
"
3150,"“thirty-three out of forty. worked like a dog on all of them.”
"
3151,"“yes right. you need eighty total to get an a.”
"
3152,"“t know, out of that the viva is ten, and the major ts fifty.”
"
3153,"“so unless you get almost a full score in the majors, you have to do decently in the
"
3154,"vivas.”
"
3155,"“t know. so this time, i have to pull it through,” i said, abjectly nervous at the thought.
"
3156,"“just relax man, a b won’t be that bad.”
"
3157,"“an a alok, i want an a.”
"
3158,"“fine then. all the best,” alok said as sasi delivered more paranthas.
"
3159,"“how 1s your girl?” ryan said.
"
3160,"“neha 1s fine. just took me to the place where her brother met with the accident. isn’t that
"
3161,"weird?” i said.
"
3162,"“maybe because you are special. and the place holds special meaning for her,” alok
"
3163,"shrugged.
"
3164,"“fatso is right. she likes you man,” ryan said. “when did her brother die anyway?”
"
3165,"“around three years ago. may 11 to be precise. he had gone jogging when they got a call
"
3166,"mid-morning, hit by a ring railway train.”
"
3167,"“wow, that 1s incredible,” alok said, “and i thought no one used the ring railway.”
"
3168,"“he wasn’t using it fatso. he just got hit by it,” ryan clarified.
"
3169,"“yes, pretty gory.” i rolled my eyes.
"
3170,"“though who goes jogging on a bloody hot may morning?” ryan wanted to know.
"
3171,"“shut up man. the guy is dead, and you are making fun of him,” i protested.
"
3172,"“no. that is not what i mean. i mean, hey fatso, what time does the first ring railway
"
3173,"train run?”
"
3174,"“t don’t know,” alok said, busy eating his paranthas and somewhat pissed at the frequent
"
3175,"reference to him as fatso.
"
3176,"“t know, ten i think. why?” i said.
"
3177,"“well, think about it, ten in the morning in may. i think it 1s close to forty degrees and
"
3178,"crap hot. who goes jogging on a may morning?”
"
3179,"“well, he did. otherwise he wouldn’t have died, right?” alok said, obviously irritated.
"
3180,"he never went jogging, so i guess he didn’t know better.
"
3181,"“t know he died. but my point 1s...” ryan said, “anyway, forget it.”
"
3182,"“what? i want to know,” i said.
"
3183,"“my point is, was it an accident at all.”
"
3184,"i woke up with a headache on the day of cherian’s viva. there were a couple of weeks left
"
3185,"until the majors, but today would seal my indem fate. “try to sleep, try to sleep,” i had told
"
3186,"myself about a million times the night before, all to no use.
"
3187,"“god, you look a mess,” ryan greeted in the toilet as we were shaving together.
"
3188,"“couldn’t sleep much. hell, i know i am going to screw this one up,” i said and slapped
"
3189,"water on my face.
"
3190,"ryan pressed the nozzle of his gillette shaving gel and prepared his twin-blade sensor
"
3191,"razor. his parents had sent him all these contraptions to look even better as if the guy
"
3192,"needed to improve his looks. why couldn’t he get a few pimples now and again like say
"
3193,"alok?
"
3194,"“listen hari,” ryan said making clean strokes across his cheek, “you have busted your
"
3195,"ass for this course already. you mess this up, and there 1s no hope for you man. you
"
3196,"probably know the answers better than anyone else.”
"
3197,"“since when has knowing the answers been a problem? and this 1s cherian, even normal
"
3198,"guys get scared,” i said.
"
3199,"“see, i am not even going for his viva. but if you are so scared, i have an idea.”
"
3200,"“you aren’t coming? ryan, it is ten percent. and cherian will go ape-shit if a student
"
3201,"doesn’t even come to the viva.”
"
3202,"“t have vowed not to view that bastard’s face as much as i can. and who cares about ten
"
3203,"percent, i don’t have to impress the dad.”
"
3204,"“up to you. i still think you should come. anyway, what is your idea?”
"
3205,"“t don’t know if it will work.”
"
3206,"“just tell me man. i am desperate,” i said.
"
3207,"ryan wiped his face with a towel. he opened a bottle of some fancy overpriced
"
3208,"american aftershave and splashed it liberally on his cheeks.
"
3209,"“vodka: the solution to all problems.”
"
3210,"“what? vodka? iam talking about a viva ryan, i am not organizing a party.”
"
3211,"“it know. but you know how vodka makes one less inhibited and makes you talk more?
"
3212,"who knows, a couple of swigs and it may work for you.”
"
3213,"“you are crazy. the viva is at eleven in the morning. it is hardly the time to drink...”
"
3214,"“tf you get a zero 1n his viva, you think neha will ever introduce you to daddy?”
"
3215,"the image of a zero and a b or c in indem flashed across my mind. “how much?”
"
3216,"“just a couple of shots. come, i have some 1n my closet.”
"
3217,"i went to ryan’s room where amidst branded clothes he hid his stash of alcohol.
"
3218,"alongside the bottle were envelopes, all with us stamps.
"
3219,"ryan poured vodka in a steel glass, making it a third-full.
"
3220,"“what are those envelopes?” i said.
"
3221,"“nothing. here, one shot... one, two, three,” ryan said.
"
3222,"i couldn’t believe the envelopes were unimportant. i mean, there were like a hundred of
"
3223,"them literally.
"
3224,"“letters from your parents, aren’t they?” i hazarded a guess.
"
3225,"“yeah. here have another one,” ryan said.
"
3226,"“you sure this won’t be too much?” i said.
"
3227,"“no. in fact have a third one just to be sure. here, i'll accompany you.”
"
3228,"with that, ryan joined me in my third shot. the vodka went down like a fireball, hitting
"
3229,"my empty stomach, spearing my intestines.
"
3230,"“all right then, off i go to meet the daddy,” i said cheerfully.
"
3231,"“all the best, hari. and listen, just don’t tell alok about the envelopes.”
"
3232,"“tell what?” i said. i hardly knew anything about them and i wouldn’t have if ryan hadn’t
"
3233,"mentioned it.
"
3234,"“nothing, just don’t mention it. they write ever y week, and send a cheque once a month.
"
3235,"i never reply, that is all.”
"
3236,"“why don’t you reply?” i asked, basking in the spirit inside of me.
"
3237,"“°’cause i hate them. actually, i don’t care about them. i mean, neither do they about me.
"
3238,"so why pretend?”
"
3239,"ryan said. “ryan, you know this whole big deal you make about not caring about your
"
3240,"parents?” the vodka spoke for me.
"
3241,"“yeah, what about that?’’
"
3242,"“t don’t think it is true. i mean, how can it be true?” i said, ignoring his hostile stance. i
"
3243,"kind of meant it. with all the gillette and aftershaves they sent, how could he not love them?
"
3244,"“tt’s true. you are a kid in life man, just go give your viva,” ryan said and lit up a
"
3245,"cigarette. smoke made the man more profound.
"
3246,"“t am going. but if it were true, why would you keep all the letters?” i asked, beating a
"
3247,"retreat.
"
3248,"cherian was already in class. my turn came 1n ten minutes and i sat next to alok.
"
3249,"“where is ryan?” he whispered, flipping through his notes. alok always revises until the
"
3250,"last minute.
"
3251,"“he is skipping it,” i said.
"
3252,"“what? he 1s crazy man,” he shook his head.
"
3253,"“says he doesn’t care. just as he doesn’t for his parents,” i said, obviously the second
"
3254,"phrase came because of the vodka.
"
3255,"“are you okay, hari? you sound kind of garbled. and what 1s that smell... wait have you
"
3256,"been drinking?”
"
3257,"“shh...keep quiet. just a little bit. ryan said it helps relax.”
"
3258,"“ryan, ryan, ryan. do you ever think for yourself?” alok said.
"
3259,"“hari,” prof cherian called my name even before i could answer alok. my moment was
"
3260,"here. my first a was to be decided 1n the next five minutes.
"
3261,"“so, what is the japanese system for manufacturing that lowers inventories?” prof
"
3262,"cherian started as usual without any greetings or pleasantries. just a straight firm voice like
"
3263,"from a machine.
"
3264,"“good morning, sir,” i said.
"
3265,"“good morning, hari. now answer my question.” his eyes looked like big, bulging
"
3266,"versions of neha’s eyes.
"
3267,"“good morning, sir,” i said again, to kick-start my brain.
"
3268,"“that is fine, hari. now answer please, 1f you don’t mind.”
"
3269,"“sir, the japanese inventory lowering system...” i began.
"
3270,"“yes, that one. you know the answer or not?” prof cherian said, his voice getting louder.
"
3271,"“t sir... i sir...” i said.
"
3272,"“tt is jit or just in time. cannot believe students today cannot answer such simple
"
3273,"questions. next one, what is the difference between assembly line and _ batch
"
3274,"manufacturing?”
"
3275,"“sir, very simple question sir... hic,” i said.
"
3276,"“why are you talking like that? and what is this smell? are you drunk mr hari? are you
"
3277,"drunk in my class?”
"
3278,"“no sir, sir, | actually know answer, sir,” i reiterated desperately.
"
3279,"“you are actually drunk. the guts of these students today!” prof cherian said and threw a
"
3280,"piece of chalk right at me. it hit me on the chest and hurt a little. even though i was drunk, i
"
3281,"knew something was going wrong. i was actually speaking at this viva, but not making any
"
3282,"sense.
"
3283,"“sir,” i said.
"
3284,"“get out of my class now. get out now.” prof cherian’s face turned red and he slammed
"
3285,"his files on the desk.
"
3286,"i picked up my notebook to leave when cherian came toward me. he took out a red pen
"
3287,"and marked a circle on my sheet. then he made another circle over it.
"
3288,"“zero, that is what you deserve. i wish i could give you negative,” he said, “and you
"
3289,"better do well in your majors for i am not going to let you get away from this that easy.”
"
3290,"i kept quiet. all those shots for a zero, which i could have earned myself anyway with or
"
3291,"without vodka.
"
3292,"“fuck!” ryan slammed a fist against his palm when he heard the story back in kumaon.
"
3293,"“what fuck? who told you to suggest such a weird idea?” alok said.
"
3294,"“t thought it would work but the shots were too big,” ryan said. he was playing with a
"
3295,"basketball, bouncing it back and forth on the wall.
"
3296,"“will you cut out that noise?” alok said, “so what are you going to do now har1?”
"
3297,"“do what? i lose the a for sure. and cherian thinks ’'m a drunkard. way to go for his
"
3298,"daughter’s boyfriend,” i said, covering my face with my hands.
"
3299,"thump, thump, thump. ryan kept silent as the only noise he made was with the ball.
"
3300,"“stop it,” alok said, grabbing the ball from ryan, “say something solid now!”
"
3301,"“alok!” someone shouted from outside. it was the security guard downstairs.
"
3302,"“phone call for alok,” the guard shouted.
"
3303,"“must be from home,” alok said, “come hari, no point discussing indem now.”
"
3304,"i came down with alok if for nothing else but to be distracted from the indem fiasco.
"
3305,"“hello, mummy. how are you? yes, i know i have not come home for a long time,” alok
"
3306,"said on the phone.
"
3307,"“what? didi got engaged? oh, you mean the boy’s side have agreed,” alok said, his
"
3308,"voice excited.
"
3309,"“yes, iam really happy, how 1s dad...i know... of course ll pay for everything once i
"
3310,"get ajob mom... yes, you are taking a loan for gifts...”
"
3311,"i could hear only half the conversation, but could pretty much figure out what was going
"
3312,"on. alok’s parents had finally managed to palm off their daughter to someone. as he
"
3313,"explained later, the groom’s family wanted a maruti car in dowry, but had agreed to defer it
"
3314,"until alok passed out and started working. that’s when the marriage would take place but at
"
3315,"least they had a deal.
"
3316,"“congratulations, your sister 1s getting married. is your family excited? or like sad or
"
3317,"something since she’ll go away?” i said to alok after the call.
"
3318,"“they are relieved more than anything i think. i just hope i get a job that pays for this
"
3319,"damn affair. apart from the car, there will be a function as well.”
"
3320,"“why don’t you guys marry her off later? what is the big hurry?”
"
3321,"“the older she gets, the more dowry people will demand. waiting will mean more
"
3322,"expense later. i’m happy the deal is cut.”
"
3323,"it sounded like credit card debt. if you don’t get rid of it now, it will cost you a lot more
"
3324,"later. the relief was understandable.
"
3325,"“what does the groom do?” i said.
"
3326,"“oh. i don’t know. i forgot to ask,” alok said.
"
3327,"several weeks later, we were 1n the kumaon mess eating dinner. it was thursday i guess,
"
3328,"for that is when kumaon had ‘continental’ dinner. in reality, it was just an excuse for mess-
"
3329,"workers to not give us real food. the menu sounded nice — noodles, french fries, toast and
"
3330,"soup. it tasted awful. the cooks made the noodles in superglue or something — they stuck to
"
3331,"each other as one composite mass 1n the huge serving pan. the french fries were cold and
"
3332,"either extremely undercooked or burnt to taste like coal. the cream of mushroom soup could
"
3333,"have been mistaken for muddy water, only it was warmer and saltier.
"
3334,"“this is bad man,” alok said as his noodles refused to vacate his fork, “i told you let’s
"
3335,"go out.”
"
3336,"“t didn’t know it would be so bad. and the semester is almost over. i am totally out of
"
3337,"cash.”
"
3338,"“that is right actually,” alok said, “better start studying for the majors. less than ten days
"
3339,"now.”
"
3340,"“yes, not that i care now. after indem messed up, i don’t really care beyond passing each
"
3341,"course.”
"
3342,"“ryan, i think you should focus on indem. cherian didn’t like you missing the viva. he
"
3343,"smirks when he mentions your name in class attendance.”
"
3344,"“t know,” ryan said, dropping his half-eaten french fry in disgust, “i got sixteen out of
"
3345,"forty in quizzes and zero in viva. need twenty-four out of fifty 1n majors to pass it.”
"
3346,"“not that easy,” i pointed out the obvious.
"
3347,"“worse case, i flunk. so what?” ryan said and tried the soup. without caring for
"
3348,"etiquette, he spewed the contents out from his mouth back into the bowl.
"
3349,"“cherian will make you do it again, it’s a core course,” alok said. “like drinking the
"
3350,"soup you just spat out.”
"
3351,"“fuck,” ryan said. i wasn’t sure if his comment was aimed at the food or the prospect of
"
3352,"repeating cherian’s course.
"
3353,"“man, if only i had an a, i could finally get neha...” i said.
"
3354,"“t think we can still do something,” ryan said.
"
3355,"“what? drink enough to forget neha?” i mocked.
"
3356,"“no. if you completely crack the majors, you can still make it, right?”
"
3357,"“t have thirty-three on forty, need eighty for an a. major is fifty points. how am i going to
"
3358,"get forty-seven on fifty?”
"
3359,"“no way man. ryan, don’t trouble the guy more. it 1s over.”
"
3360,"“tt is not over, my friends, it never is. if i tell you that you can get a perfect score in
"
3361,"majors, will you believe me?”
"
3362,"“don’t be crazy. i’d have to spend twenty hours a day on indem and will probably not
"
3363,"make it. cherian’s major test will be full of surprise questions. i am screwed...” i lamented.
"
3364,"“what if you knew the questions?” ryan said.
"
3365,"“what if; what if? ryan, are you dreaming?” alok said.
"
3366,"“no i am not dreaming, fatso. i am trying to help my friend. i think we can get the major
"
3367,"paper.”
"
3368,"“how?” i was arrested.
"
3369,"“by sneaking it out of cherian’s office,” ryan said.
"
3370,"alok and i fell silent for a full minute, took us around that much time to digest the
"
3371,"preposterousness of the idea, along with the unpalatable food.
"
3372,"“you mean steal it? steal a bloody major paper from an iit prof? is that what you said?”
"
3373,"alok said.
"
3374,"“don’t make it sound so dramatic. it is not such a big...”
"
3375,"“are you nuts? tell me, are you nuts?” alok said and walked out of the mess. i went out
"
3376,"as well, preoccupied with my coming encounter with neha, especially with how i could
"
3377,"dismiss my past encounter with daddy dearest.
"
3378,"15
"
3379,"operation pendulum
"
3380,"the next day at kumaon lawns ryan was his lordly best. “guys, just
"
3381,"listen to me.”
"
3382,"“no way, you can’t do this. please, stop this nonsense,” alok said.
"
3383,"“he has a point,” i conceded, not fully sure of what it was though.
"
3384,"“can you guys just listen to me for a minute? you don’t have to do anything,” ryan said,
"
3385,"sounding almost reasonable.
"
3386,"“sure,” i said.
"
3387,"“we have lived in this place for three years, right? and what have we got?” ryan said.
"
3388,"“oh, don’t start about the system being crappy, ryan. just come to the point,” alok said.
"
3389,"“t will, i will,” he said, realizing that he didn’t exactly have a patient audience in hand.
"
3390,"he took out a sheet from his pocket — two a4 sized sheets stuck together — and laid it out on
"
3391,"the grass. employing two pebbles as paperweight, he began with a flourish, “this,
"
3392,"gentlemen is a map of the insti building. all profs get the major papers ready and printed a
"
3393,"week prior to tests but our cherian’s a paragon, so his must be ready even earlier. here,
"
3394,"cherian’s office is on the sixth floor. the roof is on the ninth floor...”
"
3395,"ryan’s face was intense like alok’s while writing his exam paper. this was not a casual
"
3396,"conversation; he had pondered over this for a while.
"
3397,"“t told you the whole idea was crap. how can you force these details on us as if we’ve
"
3398,"said yes,” alok said.
"
3399,"but that is how ryan is, he decides, and then he proposes, and then he does whatever he
"
3400,"wants to anyway.
"
3401,"“ryan, what is all this man?” i said.
"
3402,"“just listen to me. hari, i could get you the a grade you want here. imagine, your girl will
"
3403,"finally not be ashamed to acknowledge you. and you too fatso, an a won’t look so bad on
"
3404,"your grade sheet when you apply for jobs either.”
"
3405,"“but it is so warped, so...so wrong,” alok protested, looking at me for support against
"
3406,"ryan’s latest madness. but i was already thinking of walking hand in hand with neha in the
"
3407,"insti gardens when the moon was out. could i really get an a?
"
3408,"“tt 1s wrong only if you get caught right?”
"
3409,"it was kind of hard to argue with ryan’s logic, especially if you were dreaming about
"
3410,"your beautiful girlfriend at that time. yes, it is a crime only if someone catches you.
"
3411,"otherwise, it is just a neat plan.
"
3412,"“but...” alok tried again.
"
3413,"“anyway, let me finish,” ryan said, without letting alok finish now that i looked half way
"
3414,"there.
"
3415,"“the roof is on the ninth floor. so, if i suspend myself with ropes and then sail down to
"
3416,"cherian’s window, i can get to his room. you guys can help me, just like we got hari into
"
3417,"neha’s room.”
"
3418,"“are you crazy? neha’s room was easy, no ropes or anything. and the insti building is
"
3419,"nine floors high,” i said.
"
3420,"“t am not scared. i have done rock climbing in school,” ryan said.
"
3421,"“what if the window is not open?” alok said.
"
3422,"i could see ryan liked alok’s question. not only because ryan had thought about it
"
3423,"before, but because it meant alok was buying into this. but wait a minute, was i on board
"
3424,"with this just because it was ryan? an a would be nice though.
"
3425,"“yes, what about the window?” i said.
"
3426,"“the insti windows have latches that are weaker than rubber bands. they are the same
"
3427,"windows as in kumaon hostel. one bang on the back and it opens.”
"
3428,"“still, you will suspend yourself from the roof?” i said.
"
3429,"“t said i wasn’t scared.”
"
3430,"“what if someone sees us?” i said.
"
3431,"that is the thing about ryan. he is brilliant, but also fearless. this machismo might lead
"
3432,"to an over-confidence that could kill the plan.
"
3433,"“no one will see us,” ryan said.
"
3434,"“yeah right. just three guys hanging on to the insti roof as usual. institute security
"
3435,"wouldn’t care, eh?” alok smirked.
"
3436,"“fatso, it will be super dark,” ryan said.
"
3437,"“but we could make a noise, or the movement could be seen by the security jeeps on the
"
3438,"roads. remember, we are not on the roof, but hanging by the sides. we just might be seen.”
"
3439,"“c’mon guys...” ryan said, looking bored.
"
3440,"“too risky. forget it,” alok said, tearing blades of grass. i had to nod, too. besides, just
"
3441,"the thought of ryan bungee-jumping upward made me sweat.
"
3442,"“well, you got any better ideas?” ryan said, irritated.
"
3443,"“what were you planning to do next anyway?” my curiosity got the better of me.
"
3444,"“okay, here are the next steps,” ryan pointed to the side of the paper. “one, switch on
"
3445,"light on the opposite right wall. two, scan the room for a sealed brown bag. three, open the
"
3446,"seal with a knife, and take out one copy of major paper. four, using a candle and fresh seal,
"
3447,"fasten the bag back. five, get the hell out of there.”
"
3448,"“sounds simple enough after that,” alok said, “but i guess we can’t get in. let’s go now,
"
3449,"i’m hungry.”
"
3450,"“there could be a way,” i said.
"
3451,"“what?”
"
3452,"“through the door. his main regular office door,” i said.
"
3453,"“how? break the lock? of course, you know that is impossible, with the noise and
"
3454,"everything. and he’ll know the next day,” ryan said.
"
3455,"“no lock breaking. just get in elegantly with the key,” i said.
"
3456,"“key? where the hell will you get the key?” alok said.
"
3457,"“from neha’s car keys. her dad’s office keys are in the bunch,” i said.
"
3458,"everyone fell silent for five seconds. it was the silence of admiration for sheer brilliance.
"
3459,"“wow. i guess you just have to steal the keys then,” alok said.
"
3460,"“why not just sneak them out for half an hour and make a duplicate?” ryan said.
"
3461,"“t guess. not the easiest thing to do, but can be done,” i said, and smiled smugly at my
"
3462,"own genius. cherian’s office was an open door.
"
3463,"“hari, you are a killer man. that is awesome,” ryan said.
"
3464,"he finalized the revised plan again. it seemed simple enough now, and we had invested
"
3465,"too much time 1n it to walk away from it.
"
3466,"“so we go up at night, just as we go to the roof for the vodka. but we stop at the sixth
"
3467,"floor and raid cherian’s office,” ryan said.
"
3468,"“not raid, just turn the key and slide in,” i said, impersonating a mock key with my
"
3469,"fingers.
"
3470,"“yes, up yours cherian,” ryan poked air with his middle finger. we all laughed and
"
3471,"shook hands.
"
3472,"“let us give this operation a name. something sexy, something unsuspicious and simple.”
"
3473,"“something that will swing our miserable fortunes in this place,” i said.
"
3474,"“yes, this swinging operation can be called operation pendulum,” ryan said.
"
3475,"and on that bright lawn with our sun-lit eyes, we blithely cheered in unison, “operation
"
3476,"pendulum!”
"
3477,"16
"
3478,"the longest day of my life i
"
3479,"they say no one day can be too significant in your life, but i tell you the
"
3480,"day of operation pendulum was the most memorable and longest of all my iit days. each
"
3481,"moment, each event is vivid and fresh in my mind as if it happened yesterday. it was the day
"
3482,"that changed our lives, or at least changed us.
"
3483,"there was no formal date set for operation pendulum. it was kind of like, we’d do it the
"
3484,"day i got the key thing done. the majors were less than a week away, so we were sure
"
3485,"cherian would have the papers by now. and of course, we’d need some time to figure out
"
3486,"the answers to those questions. so the sooner the better.
"
3487,"april 11, the day of operation pendulum, a day that started with my date with neha. i
"
3488,"should have seen the signs the moment neha told me she’d sprained her ankle.
"
3489,"“what?” i said over the phone, “i am dying to meet you. don’t cancel today. the majors
"
3490,"will begin after that.”
"
3491,"“but hari, i can’t even walk ten steps. please, can’t we do it some other time?”
"
3492,"“can i just see you for half an hour. how about i come home?”
"
3493,"i knew neha’s mom would not be at home that day. it was the eleventh, the day she went
"
3494,"to that temple by the tracks and sobbed for her son. that is why neha had agreed to the date
"
3495,"in the first place.
"
3496,"“home? are you mad? what if someone sees you?”
"
3497,"“third year is ending, can you stop being so scared?”
"
3498,"“but...”
"
3499,"“and what if i get an a, you'll introduce me then anyway right?”
"
3500,"“okay, but only for half an hour. and come exactly at 11.30, so i'll leave the doors open,”
"
3501,"she said.
"
3502,"“great. pl see you then,” i said, keeping the phone down with a sigh of relief. i just had
"
3503,"to see her that day, or rather see her car.
"
3504,"“everything okay?” ryan quizzed as i left kumaon.
"
3505,"“of course. see you 1n two hours,” i said.
"
3506,"“shh, quiet, just come in quickly,” neha said, whispering quite unnecessarily.
"
3507,"“no one is here,” i said.
"
3508,"“you're crazy. so, why the big urge to see me today?” neha said, leading me to her room.
"
3509,"“well, you know third year is ending and majors and everything,” i said, my eyes roving
"
3510,"around the room to spot any key-racks.
"
3511,"“so?” neha said.
"
3512,"“so i thought meeting you would be good luck for the exams,” i said sitting down on the
"
3513,"bed by her side.
"
3514,"“wow, how romantic!” she said, “and i thought my loafer was pining for me and dying for
"
3515,"me and whatever...”
"
3516,"“oh, i was,” i said and leaned forward to hug her. it was true. i was always pining for
"
3517,"her. she looked beautiful. even with her sore ankle, all pink and wrapped in a crepe
"
3518,"bandage, she managed to look beautiful.
"
3519,"“ouch, careful,” she said, pushing me back on the bed, “i know what you pine for.”
"
3520,"“what?”
"
3521,"“my body, not me,” she said, nose up in air.
"
3522,"what 1s the difference? i thought. you just cannot understand girls sometimes.
"
3523,"“that is not true,” i said, just guessing that it would be the right response.
"
3524,"“come here,” she called me and kissed me.
"
3525,"“when does mom get back?”
"
3526,"“in two hours. you know, samir bhatyya’s date.”
"
3527,"“t know, it’s the eleventh. you know neha, i wanted to ask you about that.”
"
3528,"“what about 1t?”
"
3529,"“t was talking about it to ryan...”
"
3530,"“you talked about samir to ryan?”
"
3531,"“no, just discussing how he well, died. you know the jogging and everything.”
"
3532,"“so?”
"
3533,"“so ryan made a point. a good point.”
"
3534,"“what was that?”
"
3535,"“that who goes jogging on a hot may morning?”
"
3536,"she fell silent, released me from her hug and sat away.
"
3537,"“neha?” i prompted.
"
3538,"“hari,” she said and sobbed, “hari, i didn’t want to tell you this, but i have to.”
"
3539,"“what?”
"
3540,"“wait,” she said and went to open her cupboard. a bright mélange of clothes appeared,
"
3541,"quite unlike an average kumaon guy’s closet. neha took out a folded piece of paper. “read
"
3542,"this,” she said.
"
3543,"i opened the page and my eyebrows jumped up in shock, it was signed samir.
"
3544,"dear neha,
"
3545,"i love you my little sister, as much as the day i first held you in my arms when you were
"
3546,"born. i was so proud that day, and will remain so forever.
"
3547,"neha, can you keep a secret? by the time you get this, i may not be in this world. but
"
3548,"you must understand that no one in the world must know of this letter.
"
3549,"i have tried three times to get into iit; and each time i have disappointed dad. he
"
3550,"cannot get over the fact that his son cannot handle physics, chemistry and maths. 1
"
3551,"cannot do it neha, no matter how hard i try, no matter how many years i study or how
"
3552,"many books i read. i cannot get into itt. and i cannot bear to see dads eyes.
"
3553,"he has seen thousands of iit students in his life, and cannot see why his own son
"
3554,"cannot make it. well neha, he sees the students who make it, but he doesnt see the
"
3555,"hundreds of thousands who don't make it. he has not spoken to me for two months. he
"
3556,"doesnt even talk to mom properly because of me. what can i do? keep trying until i die?
"
3557,"or simply die?
"
3558,"tf anyone finds out that i took my own life, mom would probably not be able to survive.
"
3559,"but i had to tell someone — and who else but you. i love you neha. and you tell them i
"
3560,"went jogging.
"
3561,"yours in eternity,
"
3562,"samir
"
3563,"“what the heck is this,” i said, feeling creepy . it is not ever y day that you hold a suicide
"
3564,"note in your hand.
"
3565,"“tt’s true. i should have never told you. but i’m so close to you and you start all this
"
3566,"investigation thing and...” she burst into tears.
"
3567,"“listen, now calm down,” i said, speaking more to myself than to her. she stopped crying
"
3568,"after five minutes and i gave her a glass of water.
"
3569,"“you want to know what happened in my viva?” maybe it would make her laugh. “ryan
"
3570,"made me have vodka shots,” i said.
"
3571,"neha lifted her head up and squeaked, “that was you? dad mentioned it. that was you?”
"
3572,"she started hitting me with a pillow. she was laughing again. she looked beautiful, and i
"
3573,"could have sat there admiring her beauty forever but i was on a mission today, to get the
"
3574,"keys for operation pendulum.
"
3575,"“stop, that hurts,” i said, moving toward her on the bed.
"
3576,"“don’t come near me, you drunk loafer. you know dad brooded for two hours that day.”
"
3577,"she was laughing so hard, she had to press her stomach with a hand.
"
3578,"i curled up next to her and held her. she turned her face towards me, almost 1n reflex. we
"
3579,"kissed, and then we kissed again. then she held my hand and did something that she had
"
3580,"never done before; she put it on her breast.
"
3581,"wow, my head went into a tizzy. what happened to this girl? had she lost her mind? i
"
3582,"certainly lost mine and forgot about operation pendulum.
"
3583,"my hand slid under her t-shirt and then clumsily under the bra. life would be so much
"
3584,"better without hooks.
"
3585,"“easy tiger easy,” she said. i liked it that she called me tiger.
"
3586,"she sat up to remove her t-shirt. and then the rest. i sat there transfixed, trying hard not to
"
3587,"let my tongue hang loose and pant like a dog.
"
3588,"“well tiger, are you going to remove anything or not?” she said.
"
3589,"“ti...” i said as she pulled me close.
"
3590,"half an hour later, we lay on the bed, spent but completely content. i looked up at the old
"
3591,"ceiling fan in neha’s room, going around in awkward circles and felt dizzy with happiness.
"
3592,"“so?” neha said.
"
3593,"“so what,” i said, regaining my equilibrium.
"
3594,"“say something.”
"
3595,"i was bloody beyond happy. if i did not have that key to steal, i would have stayed put
"
3596,"forever.
"
3597,"“that was quite... amazing,” i said 1n an understatement.
"
3598,"“thanks. i liked it too. i guess lama bad girl now,” she said.
"
3599,"“no, you are not,” i said, scared she might regret this and never do it again.
"
3600,"“yeah, right. here i am, lying naked with a man who was drunk in his viva, while my dad
"
3601,"is less than a kilometer away in his office,” she said and laughed, “it’s so liberating.”
"
3602,"“really?”
"
3603,"“yes, so liberating, yet so sad,” she said.
"
3604,"“relax, neha,” i said, fearing an inexplicable round of tears. “do you want to go out?”
"
3605,"“no. why, don’t you like it here?”
"
3606,"“it do. just wanted a cigarette,” i said.
"
3607,"“oh yes, i have heard cigarettes are great after sex. please get me one too,” she said.
"
3608,"“you don’t smoke!”
"
3609,"“t don’t sleep with guys either. hurry, get me a fag please.”
"
3610,"i saw the opportunity, and jumped at it. “can i take your car?”
"
3611,"“why? you didn’t get ryan’s scooter?”
"
3612,"“no, he wanted it for squash. can i?”
"
3613,"“okay, the keys are on top of the fridge. be quick though,” she said as she got up and
"
3614,"picked up my shirt.
"
3615,"“hey, that’s my shirt you’re wearing,” i pointed out.
"
3616,"“t know. i like it, it 1s so loose and perfect for a little nap,” she said and pretended to fall
"
3617,"asleep.
"
3618,"“neha. don’t be ridiculous, how am i supposed to go out?”
"
3619,"“wear my top,” she said lazily.
"
3620,"“tt’s pink, and all tight. are you nuts?”
"
3621,"“just take one of dad’s shirts 1n the closet downstairs.”
"
3622,"“neha, don’t be silly...”
"
3623,"“get lost and get the fags hari, you have tired me out,” she said and threw a pillow at me.
"
3624,"thinking if i could take prof cherian’s car and daughter, i could totally take his shirt, i
"
3625,"took out a white shirt from his closet, plain apart from the dc monogrammed on the sleeve.
"
3626,"i picked up the bunch of keys from the fridge. six of them, one surely for cherian’s office.
"
3627,"“yes!” i said to myself as i left the house.
"
3628,"i drove out on the empty road, as the mid-day sun had forced most people indoors, drove
"
3629,"to jia sarai and went straight to the duplicate key shop.
"
3630,"“which one?” the shopkeeper said.
"
3631,"“all six,” i said.
"
3632,"as the shopkeeper carved the new keys, i bought a pack of cigarettes. this was simpler
"
3633,"than i thought. i lit one and drifted into thoughts of hugging neha again. this had to be the
"
3634,"most wonderful day of my life.
"
3635,"the keys were ready soon. i put the new bunch in my pocket and drove back into campus
"
3636,"through the insti gates.
"
3637,"just as i turned toward faculty housing, i saw a bicycle ahead of me. i am mad, i am
"
3638,"stupid, a freaking jerk i thought as i honked — and turning around to look at me was cherian.
"
3639,"17
"
3640,"the longest day of my life ii
"
3641,"there are times in your life when you are so scared you scream, and
"
3642,"there are times you are so beyond scared you just freeze. i mean you kind of get fossilized in
"
3643,"an icebox and never come back to life ever again. when cherian got off his bicycle and
"
3644,"walked toward me, or rather his car, i went into deep freeze.
"
3645,"he came and stood next to me. i should have probably got out, but i was crap scared to
"
3646,"move an inch. i heard my heart, which was louder than cherian’s words. “this is my car,”
"
3647,"he said.
"
3648,"true, i thought, ten out of ten. i can control this, i said to myself and tried to breathe.
"
3649,"“yes, sir,” i said.
"
3650,"“who are you? and what are you doing in my car?” he asked next.
"
3651,"“sir, just driving back... sir,” i said, probably looking as stupid as i sounded.
"
3652,"cherian parked his bicycle on the side of the road and abandoning my role as a wax
"
3653,"model, i got out of the car. oh, where were the dinosaurs when you needed them?
"
3654,"“were you driving to my home?” cherian said, opening the front door. yes, he was going
"
3655,"to drive now. could i go home?
"
3656,"“yes, sir.”
"
3657,"suddenly his mighty brow furrowed. “i know you. you are a student, right? what 1s your
"
3658,"name?”
"
3659,"“hari, sir,” i said, glad he had asked the only thing i was sure about.
"
3660,"“you are the one who was playing tricks in my viva?”
"
3661,"i nodded, guilty as charged.
"
3662,"“get in,” cherian said.
"
3663,"i quietly opened the other front door and sat next to him. he started the car.
"
3664,"“who gave you the keys?”
"
3665,"i jumped at the last word. my hand caressed my trouser pocket from the outside. yes, the
"
3666,"set of duplicate keys was still there. i had to think of something now. any reason why i
"
3667,"could be driving his car apart from buying post-coitus cigarettes for his daughter.
"
3668,"“neha, sir,” i said after a deliberate pause.
"
3669,"“you know neha?” the professor’s eyebrows shot up.
"
3670,"“sir, i met her on the road. the car had a flat tire.”
"
3671,"“so?” cherian said.
"
3672,"“sir, i was passing by and offered to push the car to the mechanic. she had to go back and
"
3673,"i offered to bring the car home.”
"
3674,"silence from cherian. had he fallen for it? i guessed he had, for he started the car and
"
3675,"started driving it slowly.
"
3676,"“why did you offer that?”
"
3677,"“just wanted to help,” i shrugged modestly like i go about scouting for good deeds all
"
3678,"day.
"
3679,"“and you don’t have classes to attend?”
"
3680,"“a free period, sir.”
"
3681,"“sully girl,” cherian spoke aloud to himself, “gives the car to any stupid stranger. i have
"
3682,"to talk to her about this.”
"
3683,"i kept silent; a new thought had crossed my mind; if neha would be dressed. the last
"
3684,"thing i wanted right now was a surprise hug from her when she opened the door. if only i
"
3685,"could get ten seconds before she spoke to cherian. or if only i could disappear.
"
3686,"cherian parked the car at his house.
"
3687,"“sir, can i go now?”
"
3688,"“no, come in. this stupid girl should at least thank you. not that i’d ever let boys like
"
3689,"you come near my house.”
"
3690,"“right, sir.” i totally understood him.
"
3691,"cherian pressed the doorbell. neha opened the door wearing just a bed sheet.
"
3692,"“have you...” then she saw her father. “dad,” neha said, blinking her eyes and adjusting
"
3693,"her bed sheet to cover the maximum. surely, this was one hell of a kick compared to
"
3694,"cigarettes.
"
3695,"“your keys, ma’am,” i spoke quickly, “don’t worry, i got the puncture completely fixed
"
3696,"and brought your car back.”
"
3697,"“huh?” she looked at me.
"
3698,"“neha, are you out of your mind? why aren’t you dressed?” cherian said, controlling the
"
3699,"volume of his voice only because i was there.
"
3700,"neha blinked again before disappearing into her bedroom, presumably to change.
"
3701,"“this daughter of mine is mad. sit down,” cherian said.
"
3702,"“sir, we pushed the car for twenty minutes. she must be tired,” i said. well, sex was like
"
3703,"pushing a car sometimes, only a lot more pleasant.
"
3704,"neha came back wearing a very daddy’s-good-girl salwar-kameez and holding a tray
"
3705,"with two glasses of water.
"
3706,"as cherian drank his glass, i repeated, “i was just telling your dad how your car got a flat
"
3707,"tire and i helped you take it to the mechanic and then brought it back. i met sir on the way
"
3708,"here you see.”
"
3709,"“oh?” neha said, striving for an intelligent facial expression.
"
3710,"“how can you dump the car on a stranger?” cherian asked her.
"
3711,"“sorry dad,” neha said and collapsed on the sofa.
"
3712,"“sir, can i go now?” i said.
"
3713,"cherian gave half a nod and i was out of the house. i walked as fast as i could without
"
3714,"running.
"
3715,"“hari,” cherian shouted when i was at the gate.
"
3716,"i froze and turned. “yes, sir.”
"
3717,"“you are not that smart, you know,” he said.
"
3718,"i'd always known of cherian’s disdain for students with low grades. i didn’t know he’d
"
3719,"be so direct about it.
"
3720,"“sir, i know sir. i will study harder.”
"
3721,"“that is not what i meant.”
"
3722,"“sir?”
"
3723,"“t was a student once too you know. and the best one, a straight 10 all four years.”
"
3724,"“t know sir.”
"
3725,"“and if you think you can mess with my daughter and get away with it, you are wrong.”
"
3726,"i stood silent.
"
3727,"“you drink in my viva, and now i find you fooling with my daughter, in my car and
"
3728,"wearing my shirt,” cherian said and tugged at my collar. “you watch it hari, you watch it.
"
3729,"this is iit, not some bloody regional college. first the viva, and then my daughter. my
"
3730,"daughter!”
"
3731,"“sir, it is not what you think.”
"
3732,"“don’t tell me what to think. i knew my daughter was distracted these days. god, and
"
3733,"because of scum like you! you stay away from my home and my daughter. just away,
"
3734,"understand?”
"
3735,"“yes, sir,” i said, wishing cherian would let go of my collar. i was beginning to go limp.
"
3736,"i mean being caught by him on top of losing my virginity was hardly conducive to
"
3737,"strengthening me.
"
3738,"“good. i don’t want people talking, so i won’t bring this up again. but you stay away
"
3739,"from her and focus on your courses. for, hari, one slip in the insti and i will ruin you. i will
"
3740,"bloody ruin you,” cherian said, his face an unpleasant red.
"
3741,"“sir, i will stay away. just let me go,” i pleaded.
"
3742,"he released my collar, his fingers still trembling. i ran out of his gate and toward
"
3743,"kumaon. it was the fastest jog of life. i stopped only once, when i passed cherian’s bicycle.
"
3744,"i don’t know what struck me. i turned to make sure no one was around, and then released the
"
3745,"air from both the tires. damn, that monster deserved some revenge. and that just might make
"
3746,"the bastard believe there are flat tires 1n this world.
"
3747,"“no way man,” i said, panting as i reached ryan’s room.
"
3748,"“no way what? did you get the keys?” ryan said.
"
3749,"i tried to catch my breath.
"
3750,"“what happened?” alok asked as he came to ryan’s room.
"
3751,"“hell. hell happened.” i regained my pulse and related the whole story.
"
3752,"ryan started laughing. even though he is bold and everything, that is not what i expected
"
3753,"from him. cherian was there, holding my bloody collar and threatening to ruin me.
"
3754,"“fuck ryan, this is not funny,” i said.
"
3755,"“oh really,” he said, laughing even harder, “then what is it? cherian’s shirt, neha in a
"
3756,"bedsheet. the prof must have gone psycho,” ryan paused to laugh some more. “i wish i was
"
3757,"there.”
"
3758,"“shut up. this 1s added tension man,” alok said.
"
3759,"“what tension? you got the keys right?” ryan said.
"
3760,"i nodded as i took out the bunch.
"
3761,"“so we're still doing this?” i said.
"
3762,"“why not? how does cherian know about this?” ryan said and dangled the keys 1n front
"
3763,"of him like a tempting bunch of ripe grapes.
"
3764,"“t don’t know. i’m scared ryan. i really am.”
"
3765,"“just relax dude. you are in shock, sex and horror on the same day,” ryan said, laughing
"
3766,"again.
"
3767,"“hari is right. we should re-evaluate operation pendulum.”
"
3768,"“nonsense,” ryan said and became serious again, “if at all, it makes the case stronger.
"
3769,"hari’s only hope is if he cracks the majors. he can then still make cherian feel that he is not
"
3770,"such a loser after all.”
"
3771,"“thanks ryan,” i said.
"
3772,"“oh come on hari. you had a few hitches today, but still managed fine. let cherian think
"
3773,"what he wants.”
"
3774,"“wonder what he will do to neha,” i said.
"
3775,"“you can’t do anything about that, can you? and not today at least. let’s get the major
"
3776,"paper and then worry about other stuff.”
"
3777,"“you should talk to neha after a few days only. don’t worry, cherian will try and bury it.
"
3778,"he wouldn’t want the world to know. and he doesn’t look like the dad who can talk to his
"
3779,"daughter about this sort of stuff,” alok said and put his arm on my shoulder.
"
3780,"“we are friends man. just have to wait for the evening now. remember co-operate to
"
3781,"dominate,” ryan said and hi-fived both of us.
"
3782,"two hours later, at exactly five p.m. alok got a call from home. we were sitting in ryan’s
"
3783,"room and playing cards.
"
3784,"“alok! urgent phone call!” the guard below shouted at the top of his voice. alok threw
"
3785,"back his set of three cards.
"
3786,"“what is it?” i said.
"
3787,"“t don’t know. maybe my sister’s engagement date got fixed,” he yelled as he ran down
"
3788,"the stairs.
"
3789,"“let’s go down. if that is true, we can get fatso to treat us,” ryan said as we followed
"
3790,"alok down to the booth.
"
3791,"“yes mom, yes, i am fine. what happened, you don’t sound so good,” alok said.
"
3792,"ryan and i looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders.
"
3793,"“really? what? i mean how could they?” alok said as his own face dropped. ryan and i
"
3794,"backed away from the booth. no treat this time.
"
3795,"“what happened to dad? mom, speak louder this line is not clear. what happened? not
"
3796,"eating anything? for how long?” alok said as the line got disconnected. the phone had gone
"
3797,"dead.
"
3798,"he sat down on the floor of the telephone booth. the flimsy wooden box shook with the
"
3799,"weight. “can you believe this?”
"
3800,"“what? the phone has been giving trouble all week,” ryan said.
"
3801,"“the boy’s side cancelled the proposal,” alok said.
"
3802,"“why?” i said.
"
3803,"“they wanted a portion of the dowry right now. to lock in the boy. mom said she will
"
3804,"apply for a loan but it will take a few months. meanwhile, they get another deal and it is all
"
3805,"over. bloody idiots,” alok said.
"
3806,"“that sounds sick. why would you want to marry your sister off to such a family
"
3807,"anyway?” i said.
"
3808,"“t don’t know. all boys-side families are the same. and dad is upset and has not eaten
"
3809,"anything since i don’t know when. there is mayhem at home, and the bloody phone is dead.”
"
3810,"“it is probably good the phone is dead. what could you have done? get up now, let’s go
"
3811,"up and talk,” ryan said, giving alok a hand.
"
3812,"we went upstairs and stayed quiet for a while. ryan finally broke the silence.
"
3813,"“six o clock,” he said like a don to fellow-gangsters, “four hours more. we leave
"
3814,"kumaon at ten for the operation.”
"
3815,"i nodded my head, barely listening to him. i was wondering what neha was doing right
"
3816,"now.
"
3817,"“ryan,” alok said, “iam really not comfortable right now...”
"
3818,"“about what?” ryan said.
"
3819,"“t am getting nervous about this operation. first hari runs into cherian. then didi’s
"
3820,"proposal flops. and dad might just fall sick again if he doesn’t eat properly. i mean, we
"
3821,"don’t have to do this, do we?”
"
3822,"“hey wait a minute now,” ryan said as he stood up, “what has your sister’s proposal got
"
3823,"to do with this? and your dad will be fine.”
"
3824,"alok remained silent with an unconvinced expression.
"
3825,"ryan look at me and then back to alok a couple of times. he paced around the room and
"
3826,"started speaking again, “but tell me, is this the time to discuss all this? i thought we had
"
3827,"made the decision. look, we even have the keys.”
"
3828,"he jingled the bunch in his hand.
"
3829,"“but ryan, we don’t need the risk now,” alok said.
"
3830,"“there is no risk. just four hours, and we will have the paper. end of story.”
"
3831,"“hari, what do you think?” alok said.
"
3832,"“wait a minute,” ryan said, his voice louder. “are you going to make him take sides
"
3833,"again? hari, does this fatso want to do what he did after the first sem?”
"
3834,"“relax ryan,” i said, interrupting my re-playing of the last moments with neha, “why are
"
3835,"you shouting?”
"
3836,"“then tell fatso to make up his mind,” ryan said and sat down. he lit up a cigarette and
"
3837,"took a hurried puff.
"
3838,"“of course i don’t want to split, guys,” alok said.
"
3839,"“or does he want to stay here and make us do the work? so he can get the paper for
"
3840,"free?” ryan said.
"
3841,"“see, that is what he thinks. he doesn’t trust me,” alok said.
"
3842,"“relax guys, i said, “i think all of us are getting tense here. we have four hours until the
"
3843,"insti gets empty. we have the keys. we want the paper. if we do it, we do it together, right?”
"
3844,"“right!” ryan said.
"
3845,"we looked at alok.
"
3846,"“right” alok said in a volume one-tenth that of ryan.
"
3847,"“and we have thought through the risks right?” i said, looking at ryan “of course,” he
"
3848,"responded.
"
3849,"“then let us just go for it. and alok, your didi will find another match. if not now, maybe
"
3850,"when you get a job and can pay for the wedding. what is the big hurry? right?” i said
"
3851,"looking at alok.
"
3852,"“right,” alok said, his voice sounding more confident and relaxed.
"
3853,"“friends?” i said, looking at both of them.
"
3854,"“of course,” ryan and alok said in unison. “min,” alok said.
"
3855,"“good. let’s stay quiet for the next few hours,” i said, wanting to dream about neha.
"
3856,"we kept quiet for the next three hours. alok said something about being worried about his
"
3857,"dad. but we told him to relax, as his mom had handled such situations before. we did not go
"
3858,"down to the mess to eat dinner. somehow, we felt the crowds in the mess would read our
"
3859,"minds.
"
3860,"“ten 0’ clock,” ryan said and we jumped up as the clock struck the hour.
"
3861,"18
"
3862,"the longest day of my life hi
"
3863,"we wanted to leave no trail of our presence. for the first time in years,
"
3864,"we walked to the insti instead of using ryan’s scooter. we walked quietly past the hostels,
"
3865,"with books 1n hand as if going to the library for some midnight reading.
"
3866,"“so why did your parents start looking for your sister so early, how old is she?” i
"
3867,"whispered, nervous as hell.
"
3868,"“just twenty-three. i think they should look for a boy only when i start working. it would
"
3869,"be much easier for me to get a loan,” alok said.
"
3870,"i agreed.
"
3871,"“if i get a job that is. not much out there for a miserable five-pointer,” he said.
"
3872,"“well, maybe this a will lift you up a bit,” i said.
"
3873,"“shh,” ryan said as we reached the insti building.
"
3874,"we were being overcautious, as we scanned every corner for insti security guards. they
"
3875,"never hung around the lobby at this time, and we’d sneaked up the stairs dozens of times for
"
3876,"our vodka sessions. but we still split up and looked around all sides of the building — there
"
3877,"was no one.
"
3878,"cherian’s office was on the sixth floor. there was minimal lighting on the stairs, and we
"
3879,"counted aloud as we finished each flight of stairs.
"
3880,"“..and six. that 1s it guys. we get out, and cherian’s office is seventh door on the right,”
"
3881,"ryan said.
"
3882,"we stepped on to the sixth floor. there was only one small bulb lighting the entire
"
3883,"corridor.
"
3884,"“d c cherian, head of the department. bloody pig,” ryan said as he read the nameplate
"
3885,"outside cherian’s office. alok crouched behind me as ryan examined the lock.
"
3886,"“keys,” ryan extended his left hand.
"
3887,"i took out my bunch of keys and they jingled as if on stereo.
"
3888,"“keep it quiet,” alok said.
"
3889,"“stop being so scared, fatso. no one knows we’re here.” he was freaking me out.
"
3890,"“ryan, find the right key man,” i said.
"
3891,"“tm trying. there are like a million of them in this bunch. wait this one, no this one, no
"
3892,"this... ah i think this 1s it.”
"
3893,"“tt is?” alok looked dazed.
"
3894,"ryan opened the bolt in one stroke, kicking the door open. there it was, the lair of the
"
3895,"head of the department of itt delhi mechanical engineering was ours. ryan searched the
"
3896,"wall and flicked the light open.
"
3897,"“what are you doing?” alok asked.
"
3898,"“how else will we search, fatso? just relax, no one can see us. take your time and
"
3899,"search. and i want to search for something else too.”
"
3900,"“what?”
"
3901,"“my lube project proposal. cherian bloody stuck it in his office and it got nowhere. prof
"
3902,"veera told me there is a copy here somewhere with his comments.”
"
3903,"“whatever ryan. can we search for the paper first?”
"
3904,"“where do we start?” alok said as he scanned the piles of paper kept on cherian’s
"
3905,"shelves. this could take all night.
"
3906,"“look for brown bags with a red wax seal. they always open the seal at the time of the
"
3907,"papers,” ryan said.
"
3908,"we divided the shelves to save time, and started a quick scan. i ran through journals,
"
3909,"administrative documents, course outlines and timetables. nothing for twenty minutes.
"
3910,"“anything?” i asked.
"
3911,"ryan and alok shook their heads. ten minutes later, ryan stepped back and sat on
"
3912,"cherian’s chair.
"
3913,"“what?” i said.
"
3914,"“t have checked my shelves. there is nothing in mine. got my lube project though. he just
"
3915,"says ‘no commercial viability or academic value’. what a prick.”
"
3916,"“well, i can’t find anything either. do you want to help?” i said.
"
3917,"“red seal and brown bag. indem majors - confidential. is this what you are looking for
"
3918,"gentlemen?” alok said and waved the bag in front of us.
"
3919,"we jumped up.
"
3920,"“fatso, this is it man!” ryan said.
"
3921,"“yes,” i said as we hi-fived each other.
"
3922,"“t cannot believe it,” alok said.
"
3923,"“that 1s because you don’t trust me. though we still have stuff to do. so, wait while i
"
3924,"deal with this seal,” ryan said as he emptied his pockets. a blade, candle, lighter and some
"
3925,"wax to re-seal the bag.
"
3926,"“man, you come prepared,” alok said, not able to resist a smile of relief.
"
3927,"“well, what do you expect? give me a few minutes now.” ryan held the blade between
"
3928,"his thumb and the forefinger and got to work. he slowly sliced the seal open as neatly as
"
3929,"possible.
"
3930,"“where did you learn all this?” i was impressed.
"
3931,"“t am training to be an engineer. this is not that hard to figure out. now keep quiet,” ryan
"
3932,"said.
"
3933,"“how long?” alok said as sat down on the chair opposite to cherian’s. “ten minutes.
"
3934,"quiet now else i'll rip off some of the paper,” ryan said. two minutes passed. i looked at
"
3935,"alok, who sat with his hands in his face. i could tell he was thinking about home again.
"
3936,"“t hope dad feels better soon. he can really fall sick if he doesn’t eat properly. i wish i
"
3937,"could do something.”
"
3938,"given alok’s family’s love for food, i was pretty sure either of them would fall sick if
"
3939,"deprived of it.
"
3940,"“don’t worry, it is nobody’s fault. the guy’s side seems too greedy if you ask me,” i
"
3941,"consoled.
"
3942,"“they are all the same. i just want to check on dad. if only the bloody phone in kumaon
"
3943,"was working,” alok said.
"
3944,"“yes!” ryan said as he opened the seal with minimal damage. there were a hundred
"
3945,"crisp sheets inside. the fresh copies of the major paper!
"
3946,"“wow, it’s the paper. let me see it,” i said.
"
3947,"“no. i know you guys. you'll just start discussing it right now. i am keeping this with me
"
3948,"until we wrap up and get out of here,” ryan said.
"
3949,"“what else needs to be done,” alok said.
"
3950,"“t have to put a fresh seal. why do you think i brought the candle?” ryan said.
"
3951,"“anyway, i think he’ii take another million hours to finish,” alok said.
"
3952,"“hurry up, ryan,” i said.
"
3953,"“shut up,” he said as he heated a fresh blob of wax on the candle. he looked like a
"
3954,"craftsman intently at work.
"
3955,"“hey hari, cherian’s office has a phone,” alok said.
"
3956,"“yes, it’s right there,” i said, pointing to the bookshelves where the instrument was kept.
"
3957,"“maybe i can just make a quick call from here,” alok said.
"
3958,"“really? don’t you want to wait and call from outside?”
"
3959,"“tt’ll get really late. besides, i just need to check how dad is. what else do we have to
"
3960,"do now?”
"
3961,"“okay,” i shrugged.
"
3962,"alok stood up and went near the phone.
"
3963,"“t think you have to dial nine to get an outside line,” i said.
"
3964,"“now what the heck are you guys doing? can’t you just sit still,’ ryan scolded as he
"
3965,"spooned molten wax from the fresh seal.
"
3966,"“just calling home for a minute. it is too much to wait for you to finish,” alok said.
"
3967,"“can’t you call from outside,” ryan said, “or you are too cheap to spend a buck.”
"
3968,"“t just need a minute. you just pay attention to the seal,” alok said as he dialled the
"
3969,"number.
"
3970,"he got through pretty soon, and it was clear that his mother had been waiting for alok to
"
3971,"call back. alok hardly spoke, as his mother vented about her miserable life and the hapless
"
3972,"fate of his didi.
"
3973,"ryan continued dabbing some fresh wax on the underside of the old seal. i tried to pass
"
3974,"my time flipping through ryan’s lube proposal. this is when the wires got ahead of us.
"
3975,"i did not know this then, but this 1s how the insti phone system works. each prof has a
"
3976,"phone in the room that 1s part of the iit network. one uses it mainly to dial internal campus
"
3977,"numbers. to dial outside, the network connects to a few external lines. when nine is
"
3978,"pressed, the internal phone requests an external line, and the campus telecom exchange
"
3979,"switches the lines. a control switchboard in the telecom exchange does this automatically.
"
3980,"the switchboard lights up a small red bulb for every engaged line. every time one requests
"
3981,"an external line, the light turns green. this control room is 1n the institute security office on
"
3982,"the ground floor of the insti building. one night operator and a guard sit there at night,
"
3983,"mostly gossiping and snoozing through their shift. so, a little red bulb lit up on one of the
"
3984,"sixth floor phones, and then that red bulb turned green. what was prof cherian doing in his
"
3985,"room this time of the mght? the guard wondered. the operator had the option to listen in to
"
3986,"the conversation if he wanted, and he did. this wasn’t prof cherian. it was a mother
"
3987,"reciting the sad tale of her daughter to someone called alok. the security guard opened his
"
3988,"walkie talkie, and requested patrolling guards to check on cherian’s room. the patrolling
"
3989,"guard was joined by another guard as he walked up to the sixth floor.
"
3990,"unfortunately, like i said, we did not know all this then.
"
3991,"“there are some comments given on some of the pages though,” i said.
"
3992,"“all crap. cherian just didn’t want to give this project a shot. i have demonstrated results
"
3993,"of efficiency improvements. how could he close this because of no viability? that bastard,
"
3994,"ouch!” a drop of wax fell on his fingers.
"
3995,"“don’t worry. you concentrate on the seal. and hurry up, alok,” i said.
"
3996,"the two guards came and stood outside our door. they must have been standing there for
"
3997,"two minutes before they opened the door. a lit candle, melted wax, someone on the prof’s
"
3998,"chair, a few strewn papers. the guards did not need to be too educated to figure it out.
"
3999,"alok dropped the phone from his hand as he froze. his poor mother must have felt the
"
4000,"phone go dead again. actually, we all went dead. i froze in my chair too, and i don’t know
"
4001,"how, but ryan figured out what to say first.
"
4002,"“oh, guard sahib. hello, come in let me explain,” he said, trying to be as calm as
"
4003,"possible.
"
4004,"“who are you?”
"
4005,"“guard sahib,” ryan said as he stood up, almost ready to dash out if needed. alok and i
"
4006,"came up behind him as well, waiting for any sudden instructions.
"
4007,"“don’t come near us,” the guard said, “we are calling the prof now.”
"
4008,"“oh no guard sahib, listen to us,” ryan said as he went near the door. it was clear we had
"
4009,"to make a dash now.
"
4010,"the guard picked up our intentions or something, or maybe he was just scared and stupid.
"
4011,"he backed off, and shut us inside the office. we heard him bolt the door and tell his fellow
"
4012,"guard to call the prof and the chief security officer. ryan tried calling the guard again, but it
"
4013,"was to no avail. there we were, three of us locked in cherian’s office on the sixth floor at
"
4014,"midnight.
"
4015,"we didn’t say a word, we just looked at each other’s faces. we could do nothing but wait
"
4016,"and wait and wait. the longest day of my life wouldn’t get over...
"
4017,"19
"
4018,"the longest day of my life iv
"
4019,"i kind of went inside myself in that short span of time before cherian’s
"
4020,"office door opened again and sealed our fate, just sat quietly and ignored what ryan and
"
4021,"alok said, that is if they did say anything. future scenes erupted in my mind. by tomorrow
"
4022,"morning, all profs, all students at kumaon and other hostels would know about us. caught
"
4023,"stealing the major paper from prof cherian’s office, no less! probably the insti director
"
4024,"would also come on this special occasion. cherian would get us all shot if he could, but
"
4025,"either way he would definitely not go easy on us. what did they call it? disciplinary
"
4026,"committee or disco, for deciding the fate of the students who broke discipline. suddenly,
"
4027,"my five-point gpa seemed wonderful to me. if only i could pass out of this place with a
"
4028,"simple job and this could all be over. but even keeping that gpa and passing out was not
"
4029,"going to be easy now. will cherian soften if we grovelled? should we just deny that we
"
4030,"had come here to cheat? should we just admit everything and apologize? can we just
"
4031,"rewind a few minutes and stop alok from making that call? could i just re-live this one
"
4032,"day?
"
4033,"these stupid questions darted about like rabbits inside my head. i took a deep breath; we
"
4034,"just had to live through these moments.
"
4035,"“someone’s come,” ryan said and we stood up. the bolt was opened and around ten
"
4036,"people swarmed in. i recognized the two security guards and the chief security officer by
"
4037,"their uniforms. the other guy with them was the telephone exchange operator, i knew since
"
4038,"he wore an insti uniform. these morons with dull jobs were the heroes of the day.
"
4039,"and then it was a couple of profs from the mechanical engineering department. even
"
4040,"prof veera was there. and of course, there was the man whose office we had temporarily
"
4041,"occupied — cherian. he stood there shocked, wondering how his office was broken into so
"
4042,"cleanly. it was the who’s who of iit, most of them in their pajamas. people get more pissed
"
4043,"off if they are disturbed in their pajamas.
"
4044,"the guard told everyone to come inside the room, keeping an eye on us as if we’d try to
"
4045,"make a dash again.
"
4046,"“you?” cherian said, looking straight at me. he must have been wondering: his daughter
"
4047,"in the morning and his office in the evening. i’d be pissed if someone screwed all over my
"
4048,"life in one day.
"
4049,"“what are you doing here?” prof veera said, probably aware of what we had been up to.
"
4050,"the guard had told everyone what he had seen a million times; the candle, the seal and the
"
4051,"major papers. maybe prof veera was just giving us a chance to verbalize a good lie to get
"
4052,"out of this.
"
4053,"we said nothing, hoping silence would evaporate us.
"
4054,"“cheating, sir, stealing major paper. my boys caught them,” the security chief said, proud
"
4055,"as if they had broken a cia ring.
"
4056,"“you were stealing the paper from my office? how did you get in?” cherian asked me
"
4057,"directly.
"
4058,"“you know him?” one of the profs asked cherian.
"
4059,"“not really. i have just seen him in class, a very poor student. he was even drunk in my
"
4060,"viva, you know dean shastri. yes, that 1s the only time i remember him from, hari kumar,
"
4061,"isn’t 1t?”
"
4062,"i guess cherian did not want to mention our morning tryst to the rest of the profs.
"
4063,"“and the others? what are your names?” the dean said.
"
4064,"“alok gupta, sir. kumaon hostel, mechanical engineering,” alok said.
"
4065,"“ryan oberoi, same,” ryan said.
"
4066,"“and you think you are too smart?” the dean said.
"
4067,"“no sir. that is why we wanted the paper, sir,” ryan said.
"
4068,"slap! the dean slapped ryan right across the face. i don’t blame him, ryan could have
"
4069,"chosen a better time to make a wisecrack.
"
4070,"slap! slap! before i realized what was happening, the dean deposited a slap on alok and
"
4071,"me as well.
"
4072,"god, i tell you, it was humiliating. profs, security guards and cherian all staring at us
"
4073,"while our faces turned red on the left. but we kept quiet. i secretly hoped they would all
"
4074,"slap us and get it out of their system. heck, they could trash us senseless as long as that was
"
4075,"the only punishment. please don’t do a disco and screw with our career.
"
4076,"“you are criminals. you realize? you are criminals. call the police,” cherian said, his
"
4077,"whole being trembling, as if he was the one being slapped around.
"
4078,"he was walking to the phone when prof veera spoke, “cherian sir, one minute before you
"
4079,"call the police sir, this will become a big deal.”
"
4080,"“tt is a big deal,” cherian screamed out loud. just slap us, cherian, i thought. i know he
"
4081,"wanted to, especially me.
"
4082,"“dean shastri, you explain to him. police will mean the case will hit the papers. i mean,
"
4083,"do you really want iit in the news for all the wrong reasons,” prof veera reasoned.
"
4084,"“hmmm,” dean shastri said, rubbing his hands.
"
4085,"“sir, we have mechanisms in the insti to deal with this, right? the police will not arrive
"
4086,"without reporters,” prof veera said.
"
4087,"“veera might be right. i don’t want the itt name in mud because of these miscreants.”
"
4088,"even in this situation, i felt the word ‘miscreant’ was quite cute and funny. i almost
"
4089,"smiled.
"
4090,"“sir, i don’t want to spoil the iit name either. but i want these boys to suffer. who do
"
4091,"they think they are?” cherian said as he stopped cuddling the phone.
"
4092,"“t agree, this 1s quite outrageous. we cannot decide their fate so easily. we have a
"
4093,"mechanism, not that we use it often. take them to disco.”
"
4094,"it was time for us to shiver as we heard the last word. maybe our silence was not so
"
4095,"golden after all. do something oh clever ryan, i wanted to say but he stood silent. only
"
4096,"alok did something. in his usual manner, he began to cry.
"
4097,"“sir, please sir. we are so sorry, sir...” he said.
"
4098,"“no more discussion. bloody standard of these students falling every year. we’ll talk in
"
4099,"an urgent disco — tomorrow!” declared the dean.
"
4100,"“dean sir, you can test intelligence in entrance exams, but how to test for integrity?” the
"
4101,"security chief said. he probably got less credit for his achievement that night.
"
4102,"a crowd gathered around the kumaon hostel notice board the next morning. on a small
"
4103,"piece of paper, the size of a bank cheque, the short notice was enough to start long
"
4104,"conversations.
"
4105,"“this is to inform that there will be a disciplinary committee meeting starting at
"
4106,"10:00 pm tonight in the mechanical engineering department conference room. the
"
4107,"agenda of the meeting is to decide the course of action for alleged disciplinary breaches
"
4108,"by hari kumar (kumaon), alok gupta (kumaon) and ryan oberoi (kumaon) on april
"
4109,"1.”
"
4110,"the three of us were too ashamed to come to the notice board. we cut through the crowd
"
4111,"as quickly as possible, even though we heard some questions.
"
4112,"“what happened?” said anurag, “skipping too many classes or what?”
"
4113,"“that doesn’t lead to a disco. must be something else.”
"
4114,"“t think this 1s big. they are holding the disco in one day,” another kumaonite said.
"
4115,"“yes, at night too. something to do with the mechanical engineering department.”
"
4116,"we let the smart inmates of kumaon figure out what was going on. we simply looked
"
4117,"down and headed out of campus. courtesy neha, i knew a few places where no one would
"
4118,"find us. the ice-cream parlour seemed perfect. alok reached straight for the counter and
"
4119,"came back with three strawberry cones.
"
4120,"“ryan, you got cash? i don’t have any,” alok said, passing us our treats.
"
4121,"“fatso, you can’t resist food even at this time,” i said.
"
4122,"“tt 1s ice-cream man. just trying to distract myself, you know i didn’t sleep for two
"
4123,"seconds last night.”
"
4124,"“me neither,” i said.
"
4125,"“what do you think they’11 do?” alok said.
"
4126,"“maybe an f in indem,” ryan hazarded a guess.
"
4127,"“an f! [have never got an f and we’ll have to repeat the course,” alok said.
"
4128,"“t know. but it 1s not the end of the world,” ryan said.
"
4129,"“are you guys dreaming? they will hold a night-time disco with all these profs and all to
"
4130,"give just us a measly f?’’ i said.
"
4131,"ryan and alok looked at me as if i just stolen the cherry off their ice-cream.
"
4132,"“sir, come to reality. the disco meets rarely. and when they do, they have no mercy.”
"
4133,"“so what can they do?” alok said.
"
4134,"“they could expel you from college. or more commonly, suspend you for a year or a
"
4135,"semester.”
"
4136,"“expel?” alok said, shivering as if the ice-cream had given hima cold.
"
4137,"“they won’t expel. that has never happened. even to people who have been caught
"
4138,"stuffing coke bottles you know where,” ryan said.
"
4139,"“they could suspend you for a semester or a year. that 1s enough to fuck your future. you
"
4140,"try getting a job after that,” i said.
"
4141,"“for a whole semester? what will we do then?” alok said. looked like our man was just
"
4142,"waking up.
"
4143,"i kept silent. ryan finished his strawberry cone and tossed the tissue straight into the bin.
"
4144,"“say something guys. what will happen then?”
"
4145,"“figure it out fatso. your grade sheet will have no grades for a semester or two. it may
"
4146,"actually have ‘suspended’ stamped all over it. makes for a great conversation starter in a
"
4147,"job interview, eh?” ryan said.
"
4148,"“t think no one will give you a job, the bloody us types take this cheating stuff pretty
"
4149,"seriously. no admission to mba colleges either — they will ask the same in an interview.”
"
4150,"“in other words, our lives are screwed,” i said, noticing i had not touched my ice-cream.
"
4151,"the cone was a gooey mess, i passed it to ryan to chuck into the bin.
"
4152,"“and you guys are calm about it? how can you be so calm about 1t? what will my parents
"
4153,"think? what will happen to didi?” alok said, putting his elbows on the table and pulling at
"
4154,"his hair. then he tucked his face in his arms, to hide his tears.
"
4155,"“who the hell says i am calm about it?” ryan said and stood up, his voice loud enough to
"
4156,"stir the sleepy cashier at the counter.
"
4157,"“be quiet and sit down. there might be people from the insti here,” i said.
"
4158,"“fuck the people. and fuck the insti. and fuck this fatso who feels only he loses sleep at
"
4159,"night and cares about his future! wake up mr alok, this 1s not the time to cry and pull hair.
"
4160,"we have a bloody disco in ten hours, and maybe we should think about how we are going to
"
4161,"answer the bloody profs.”
"
4162,"“oh yes,” alok stood up this time. i guess it 1s easier to shout when you are standing up.
"
4163,"“oh yes, mr ryan,” alok said, “so it is you with all the brains to think strategy at this
"
4164,"moment. i say, fuck you and your strategy. what happened to operation pendulum?”
"
4165,"it was pointless for me to try and keep them quiet. they needed this i guess.
"
4166,"“operation pendulum? you are telling me that was bad strategy? which bloody baby had
"
4167,"to call mom?” ryan said.
"
4168,"“oh yes. and which iitian in history breaks into a prof’s office? “nothing can happen’.
"
4169,"my bloody ass nothing can happen.”
"
4170,"they argued for five minutes after which i broke into tears. they were coming on their
"
4171,"own, even though i didn’t think this disco would get the better of me. man, i was crying like
"
4172,"alok. it was embarrassing as hell, but at least they noticed me.
"
4173,"“what is wrong with you now?” ryan said.
"
4174,"“nothing. just stop shouting both of you. this won’t help. we need each other now.”
"
4175,"“he is right. sit down, fatso,” ryan said.
"
4176,"all of us sat in the ice-cream parlour for the next five hours. over two banana toffee
"
4177,"cones, one mint chocolate chip and three raspberry delights we figured out the best
"
4178,"arguments to save our lives. there was little hope, but we had to do what we could. our
"
4179,"strategy was hardly creative — it was to be honest, stay calm and beg for mercy. we only
"
4180,"reached kumaon at six p.m., where i had at least six phone messages from prof veera. he
"
4181,"wanted to see us before the disco, and we agreed to meet him at nine.
"
4182,"“you got duplicate what made?” prof veera asked again, more in shock at the story we had
"
4183,"told him.
"
4184,"“keys sir. for six rupees at jia sarai,” i said.
"
4185,"prof veera sat back in his chair and burst into laughter.
"
4186,"“this 1s incredible. i have never heard this in iit. so ryan, you thought you could just go
"
4187,"into the head of department’s office and steal the paper and end up with an a.”
"
4188,"“yes sir,” ryan said in a suitably humble voice.
"
4189,"“and you hari went and sneaked out the keys from neha, who you say 1s your girlfriend,
"
4190,"so that you could steal from her dad’s office.”
"
4191,"“that is correct, sir,” i said.
"
4192,"“and you alok, just went along with this crazy plan of theirs.”
"
4193,"“they are my friends, sir,” alok said.
"
4194,"i have to say this statement touched me. for a moment, i forgot the hell around me and felt
"
4195,"good that alok found that reason enough.
"
4196,"“you guys are idiots. you know, just big idiots, that is what you are,” prof veera said. he
"
4197,"seemed pretty harsh, but we liked him. besides, he was right.
"
4198,"“sir, we almost made it. alok made this phone call...” ryan said.
"
4199,"“almost made it?” prof veera interrupted, “is that what it is all about? you think i am
"
4200,"calling you an idiot because you got caught?” the tone of prof veera’s voice had become
"
4201,"firmer. this was the closest he got to being real mad.
"
4202,"“you, ryan oberoi, i thought was one of the most brilliant students we had ever had.
"
4203,"your lube project was the best work i have seen come out of a student. i don’t care about
"
4204,"your grades at all. but you were stupid enough to risk your future for a stupid letter on your
"
4205,"grade sheet.”
"
4206,"ryan hung his head.
"
4207,"“and the three of you are best friends. but none of you was able to stop each other from
"
4208,"this madness. you know cherian would have thrown you into jail.”
"
4209,"“sir, we'll say we are sorry sir. maybe they will be kind,” alok said.
"
4210,"“kind? this is the disco, not mother teresa’s home. you saw cherian’s face,” prof
"
4211,"veera said.
"
4212,"the three of us became silent. we could hear the clock ticking in prof veera’s office. it
"
4213,"was nine-thirty.
"
4214,"“so what is your plea to the disco? guilty or not guilty?” prof veera said.
"
4215,"“guilty. they caught us red-handed sir,” i said.
"
4216,"“hmm. i think the first thing you have to do 1s get the expulsion stuff out of the way,” prof
"
4217,"veera said.
"
4218,"“you mean there is a chance?” alok said.
"
4219,"“not too high, unless cherian is hell-bent on it. what are you going to say about the
"
4220,"keys?” prof veera said.
"
4221,"“t don’t want to bring neha into this. i thought we’d just say we collected lots of keys and
"
4222,"tried them until one worked,” i said.
"
4223,"“why not tell them the truth? you have told me everything,” prof veera said.
"
4224,"“t don’t want neha to know,” i said.
"
4225,"“listen boys, i am trying to help you here. i think you are in a big mess but if you can
"
4226,"twist this a bit, you may save yourself some trouble.”
"
4227,"“like how?”
"
4228,"“one, we should try and present some alternatives of punishment. i will be there, so i can
"
4229,"suggest an f in the course, a public apology and hundred hours of community service.”
"
4230,"“what 1s community service?” ryan said.
"
4231,"“just helping around in the campus — painting cycle parks or planting trees - that kind of
"
4232,"stuff,” prof veera said.
"
4233,"“t hate that stuff,” ryan said.
"
4234,"“shut up ryan. that is fine. please continue sir,” i said.
"
4235,"“two, i want you to twist the story a bit. i hate lying, but you won’t have much of a
"
4236,"chance other wise. so, instead of saying you tried different keys, say that neha gave the keys
"
4237,"to you,” prof veera said.
"
4238,"“what?” all three of us said in unison.
"
4239,"“listen, if you say that you know neha, and somehow she was upset with her father and
"
4240,"gave you the keys to get even, it will get personal. the disco committee will think you
"
4241,"didn’t actually break in. i don’t know, they may see right through it, but i think you should
"
4242,"take a chance.”
"
4243,"“what will neha think when she finds out?” i said, “no way we can do this.”
"
4244,"“an upset girlfriend is better than a tainted degree and no jobs after college,” prof veera
"
4245,"said.
"
4246,"“prof veera 1s right hari,” ryan said, “you bring cherian’s family into this and he may
"
4247,"withdraw. last thing he wants 1s everyone to know that you are his daughter’s boyfriend.”
"
4248,"“but this will let the whole world know,” i said.
"
4249,"“you don’t have to tell the whole story. just say neha 1s a recent friend of yours. i am
"
4250,"sure cherian will not dispute that,” alok said.
"
4251,"“alok, even you think this is the way?” i said.
"
4252,"“yes, we have to save our ass right? c’mon, it is just a last-ditch survival strategy. last-
"
4253,"ditch survival,” alok said.
"
4254,"i hated myself for agreeing to that story. what would neha think when she heard what i
"
4255,"said? that she helped me by giving the keys? she’d probably hate me forever. the clock
"
4256,"struck ten, and it was time to go to the departmental committee room.
"
4257,"romance was secondary to survival right now.

4262,"lighting is dull, the room dead silent and almost everyone elderly. around ten profs sat
"
4263,"around a semicircular table, while the accused students were bang in the centre. profs fire
"
4264,"questions at students from all directions, the location placing us at minimum distance to each
"
4265,"one of them. it is essentially a more efficient design of a courtroom, i guess, indem-inspired.
"
4266,"dean shastri asked us to take our places. dean shastri, director verma and prof cherian
"
4267,"formed the co-chairpersons. prof veera was one of the other seven profs who mattered little
"
4268,"in the scheme of things. a lot of them yawned, probably used to being in bed at this time. of
"
4269,"course, for their students, dumped with another set of assignments, the night would have just
"
4270,"begun.
"
4271,"“may the disciplinary committee begin, fellow co-chairs,” dean shastri said in what i
"
4272,"felt was a complete waste of courtesy.
"
4273,"“you may begin,” the director and prof cherian said. i guess this formality gave them an
"
4274,"extra sense of power.
"
4275,"what if i was speechless today, i thought and sweat broke out all over me. all the profs
"
4276,"opened the special disco file, which contained a description of last night’s shenanigans.
"
4277,"ryan noticed my nervousness. it is amazing how people who know you well can sense
"
4278,"everything. “hari,” he whispered.
"
4279,"i looked at him.
"
4280,"“t know what you are worried about. remember, this is not a viva. if you don’t open your
"
4281,"trap here, you will be in deeper crap than a bloody zero. you understand, don’t you?”
"
4282,"“uh, yes,” i said.
"
4283,"“and i want you to know that even though i hate to admit it, you are a bloody stud,” ryan
"
4284,"said.
"
4285,"“why?”
"
4286,"“because, in front of you lies a man who controls your future right now. yet, whatever he
"
4287,"may do, he can’t take away one fact.”
"
4288,"“what?”
"
4289,"“that you went and slept with his only daughter in broad daylight. that my friend is a true
"
4290,"stud,” ryan said.
"
4291,"“you think so?” i perked up.
"
4292,"“t do. i salute you man. i am proud to have a friend like you,” ryan said.
"
4293,"i beamed.
"
4294,"“no talking amongst the students,” dean shastri said and looked up from his file.
"
4295,"“sorry sir,” i said. ryan and i pointed thumbs at each other. damn it, i could answer these
"
4296,"old bozos any time.
"
4297,"“mr hari kumar, the files here state that you were found in prof cherian’s office last
"
4298,"night with two friends. is that right?” dean shastri said.
"
4299,"“yes sir,” i said.
"
4300,"“ryan oberoi, we learn that security found you with a candle, wax seal and the packet of
"
4301,"major papers in hand. is that right?”
"
4302,"“yes, sir,” ryan agreed.
"
4303,"“alok gupta, we learn that it was you who was making a call from prof cherian’s phone
"
4304,"last mght.”
"
4305,"alok nodded.
"
4306,"“do you boys realize the gravity of this incident?” the director said.
"
4307,"“yes sir, we got carried away sir,” i said. man, i was surprised i was taking the initiative
"
4308,"to answer these questions.
"
4309,"other questions were part-rhetoric, part-moral in nature. i can’t even remember all of
"
4310,"them now, it was about integrity and strength of character and all that stuff. we just
"
4311,"apologized, probably a million times. ultimately they asked the question we were waiting
"
4312,"for.
"
4313,"“how did you get into my office?” prof cherian said.
"
4314,"“we had the keys, sir,” ryan said.
"
4315,"“how did you get the keys?” he looked baffled.
"
4316,"“sir, we sir...” i said and turned silent. no, i couldn’t do this.
"
4317,"“hari’s friend neha gave it to us,” ryan supplied.
"
4318,"“who 1s neha?” dean shastri asked.
"
4319,"“neha cherian is prof cherian’s daughter. i know her as a friend for the past three
"
4320,"months,” i said.
"
4321,"the room fell silent as dean shastri and director verma’s mouths went slack. they
"
4322,"turned toward prof cherian, as if he was next in the firing line. but that was not disco
"
4323,"protocol.
"
4324,"“what? you sure of what you are talking about?” dean shastri said.
"
4325,"“t am. she was upset with her father and wanted to get even. she offered the keys and we
"
4326,"got carried away,” i said.
"
4327,"there were not too many questions after that. but somehow, every prof wanted to talk to
"
4328,"their neighbour. even the seven sleepy profs woke up; this was more interesting than a
"
4329,"simple caught-red-handed case.
"
4330,"cherian whispered something in dean shastri’s and director verma’s ears. dean shastri
"
4331,"nodded and made an announcement.
"
4332,"“we are done with investigating the students. i think we now need to deliberate in the
"
4333,"committee to come up with the important decision. this may take some time, even a couple
"
4334,"of hours. but once we finish, we will have a final decision. no appeals, no pleas. the
"
4335,"students may leave now.”
"
4336,"dean shastri signaled us to leave the room. we left the disco room and came out to the
"
4337,"campus lawns.
"
4338,"“how do you think that went?” alok said.
"
4339,"i shrugged my shoulders. the thought of neha kicked me in the stomach.
"
4340,"“who knows? let’s wait near here,” ryan said, sitting down on the wet midnight grass.
"
4341,"“tt could take hours,” i said.
"
4342,"“what else do we have to do? but let’s not wait near here. let’s go to the insti roof,”
"
4343,"alok said.
"
4344,"i liked the idea of the insti roof. it was the one place where we felt secure now, as even
"
4345,"kumaon was difficult to be in right now, with a million eyes on us.
"
4346,"“how will we find out they are done?” ryan said.
"
4347,"“we'll keep looking down. the corridor light is on. when they come out, we should be
"
4348,"able to see something.”
"
4349,"“fine, let’s go up,” ryan said.
"
4350,"we sat on the roof of the institute building, each of us five feet apart at the ends of an
"
4351,"imaginary triangle. the moon shone too audaciously for what 1s, after all, just reflected
"
4352,"light. it was different on the roof that day. i hated myself for dragging neha into this. in fact,
"
4353,"i hated myself for being a cheat. and for everything else — agreeing to duplicate the keys,
"
4354,"being a part of operation pendulum and bringing my life to this. how did i get here? i was
"
4355,"a topper in my school all my life. that is how i got into itt, right? but then why am i now
"
4356,"a low-performer, five-point something cheat sitting on the insti roof at midnight, unsure
"
4357,"of my future?
"
4358,"it is funny how your mind comes up with questions. damn it, it 1s up to the mind to come
"
4359,"out with the answers, so why can’t it just keep its doubts to itself? i realized i was not
"
4360,"making sense. two sleepless nights in a row didn’t help. but the questions would not stop.
"
4361,"i looked at my friends. friends? what the hell is that anyway? who is this alok? and
"
4362,"what the fuck do i care that his father is half-dead and his sister can't be married without
"
4363,"cash? then i turned to look at ryan. yes, the stylish, smart and confident ryan. the man
"
4364,"who was so sure of himself, he could take on the world. he wanted his revenge on cherian.
"
4365,"now what exactly is the point of that? doesn’t seem like all his ideas are quite so smart
"
4366,"after all. why do i listen to him and not alok? and why is everybody so quiet now?
"
4367,"i bent my head to check the time on ryan’s swiss watch. it was three in the morning.
"
4368,"“tea?” ryan said, rubbing his hands.
"
4369,"“no, ’m already wide awake, thank you,” i said.
"
4370,"“yeah. i am fine too,” alok said.
"
4371,"tea. that is the best ryan can come up with right now. a shot of caffeine as compensation
"
4372,"for throwing away everything that mattered to us.
"
4373,"“tt’s cold here,” ryan said.
"
4374,"i nodded my head. yes ryan, it is miserably cold, infect, almost like a december night in
"
4375,"delhi, i wanted to say. but you know what, i don’t feel it. there are more important
"
4376,"miserable things happening right now. like we could be thrown out of iit in a few hours,
"
4377,"and may never find a respectable education or job again. i chose another response. “yes,
"
4378,"must be five degrees,” i said.
"
4379,"half an hour passed. ryan stood up and walked to the precipice of the roof. nine stories
"
4380,"high, this is the highest point in the institute. yet, there is no parapet, as the roof is officially
"
4381,"out of bounds. one step more and ryan could enjoy his last few seconds of free-fall
"
4382,"weightlessness. he stands on the edge and bends forward to look down. he extends one leg
"
4383,"out.
"
4384,"“what are you doing?” alok said.
"
4385,"yes, what exactly are you doing ryan, i thought. haven’t we lived on the edge long
"
4386,"enough? isn’t our life screwed up enough already? can’t we wait for the disco results in
"
4387,"silence without engaging in attention-seeking behaviour, please?
"
4388,"“come back, ryan,” i called out.
"
4389,"he turned around. “tt is really high here.” slowly, he retreated and came back to where
"
4390,"he’d been sitting.
"
4391,"yes, itis high. yes, it is cold. any other insightful statements, sir, i wondered.
"
4392,"if there 1s one thing men completely lack, it 1s the ability to communicate during tough
"
4393,"moments. alok and i have no words at all, while the best ryan can come up with is
"
4394,"comments on our thermodynamic and spatial state. so different from neha who always has
"
4395,"something appropriately verbal for any occasion. but there won’t be any more neha after
"
4396,"this, especially after alok’s so called “last-ditch survival” strategy 1n the disco interview.
"
4397,"no more neha — my stomach churns as the fact finally registers. so here i am, sitting with
"
4398,"my two best friends, one will get me thrown out of the college that i worked two years to get
"
4399,"into and endured for another three years. the other has ended whatever semblance of a love
"
4400,"life i ever had.
"
4401,"“you think the disco might be lenient?” alok said.
"
4402,"“tt is the disciplinary committee, not a joke. you know the disco never spares,” i said.
"
4403,"disco, what a name, i find it funny even at this hour, even when i am in the middle of it.
"
4404,"ryan looked up at both of us. “this was all a bad idea,” he said.
"
4405,"thank you, ryan. it is cold, it is very high and yes, operation pendulum was a bad idea.
"
4406,"just keep these obvious statements coming.
"
4407,"we heard a noise downstairs at four-thirty. a few scooters started, as tired profs wanted
"
4408,"to rush back home. that was our cue; the results were out.
"
4409,"“c’ mon guys, we need to race down,” i said.
"
4410,"“yes, let’s go. prof veera should be there,” ryan said.
"
4411,"“t am going to stay here. just come back and tell me,” alok said.
"
4412,"“just come down, fatso,” ryan said.
"
4413,"“no, i can’t face the profs when they tell me,” he said.
"
4414,"“whatever then. let us go, hari,” ryan said.
"
4415,"we ran down the stairs. most of the profs had left. dean shastri, cherian and veera
"
4416,"remained.
"
4417,"“prof veera sir,” ryan said as he approached him from behind.
"
4418,"“ryan,” prof veera said, “just a second.”
"
4419,"prof veera spoke to cherian and dean shastri for a few more minutes. soon all of them
"
4420,"wished each other good mght. cherian went to his car, the one that had allowed all this to
"
4421,"happen.
"
4422,"“sir?” t said.
"
4423,"“ryan and hari, you have not been expelled,” prof veera said.
"
4424,"“really? so what was the decision?” i said.
"
4425,"“we talked for hours. there was divided opinion, but ultimately the disco decided that
"
4426,"the three of you are suspended for one semester.”
"
4427,"“sir?” t said.
"
4428,"“t tried guys. but the disco doesn’t go easy. you lose a semester, which means you have
"
4429,"only one last semester to do fourth year courses. also, you get an f in indem, and you have
"
4430,"to repeat it again. not to mention the final year project. as of now, insti rules do not allow
"
4431,"to take that much course-load,” prof veera said.
"
4432,"“so we have to do courses next year. and we can’t sit for job interviews either,” i said.
"
4433,"“t am afraid so. i tried talking to prof cherian about allowing some project credit in the
"
4434,"suspended semester. i asked if you guys could work with me. but he just said no.
"
4435,"suspension means full suspension.”
"
4436,"“tt’s over. our grade sheets are ruined. we can’t get a job. and we have to wait an extra
"
4437,"year to get a useless degree,” i said.
"
4438,"ryan kept silent.
"
4439,"“t am sorry it turned out this way guys,” prof veera said, patting our shoulders. he
"
4440,"walked past us to his scooter. a few seconds and some exhaust smoke later, he was gone.
"
4441,"we climbed up to the insti roof, where alok waited with his hands folded. maybe he was
"
4442,"praying. or maybe he was just cold.
"
4443,"“kicked out for one sem. f in indem. need to stay until next year to complete course,”
"
4444,"ryan said, summing it up for alok.
"
4445,"“what?” alok said, coming out of his trance.
"
4446,"“prof veera tried, saved an expulsion. but it is still pretty screwy. i don’t know what
"
4447,"we'll do,” i said.
"
4448,"we sat down again. it was five a.m., just one hour before daybreak.
"
4449,"alok stood up without saying anything. i wished he would, as his face seemed tense as
"
4450,"hell. he walked to the edge of the roof where ryan had stood just an hour back.
"
4451,"“you were right ryan. it is pretty high here,” alok said.
"
4452,"“you okay alok?” ryan said.
"
4453,"“yes. you think only you can stand on the edge of the roof?” alok asked.
"
4454,"“no. just come back and let us go down. i have had enough,” ryan said.
"
4455,"alok continued to look down as he replied, “for once ryan, i agree with you. i’ve had
"
4456,"enough too. i think p’il just go down.”
"
4457,"there was something messed up in the tone of alok’s voice. i turned around to look at
"
4458,"him. he stood straight, then one jump up and then straight down. in half a second, he was out
"
4459,"of sight. gravity had done its job.
"
4460,"21
"
4461,"the longest day of my life vi
"
4462,"i had never been inside an ambulance before. it was kind of creepy
"
4463,"inside. like a hospital was suddenly asked to pack up and move. instruments, catheters,
"
4464,"drips and a medicine box surrounded two beds. there was hardly any space for me and
"
4465,"ryan to stand even as alok got to sprawl out. i guess with thirteen fractures you kind of
"
4466,"deserve a bed. the sheets were originally white, which was hard to tell now as alok’s
"
4467,"blood covered every square inch of them. alok lay there unrecognizable, his eyeballs rolled
"
4468,"up and his tongue collapsed outside his mouth like an old man without dentures. four front
"
4469,"teeth gone, the doctor later told us.
"
4470,"his limbs were motionless, just like his father’s right side, the right knee bent in a way
"
4471,"that would make you think alok was boneless. he was still, and if i had to bet my money,
"
4472,"i'd have said he was dead.
"
4473,"“if alok makes it through this, i will write a book about our crazy days. i really will,” i
"
4474,"swore. it is the kind of absurd promise you make to yourself when you are seriously messed
"
4475,"up in the head and you haven’t slept for fifty hours straight...
"
4476,"the ambulance took us to aiims, the biggest hospital in delhi. the blood and two
"
4477,"sleepless mghts had made me numb. i don’t know who called the ambulance, or who made
"
4478,"the choice of hospital. maybe it was the security guard. everyone around me seemed to be
"
4479,"acting urgently.
"
4480,"more medical professionals at the aiims emergency ward. this was a government
"
4481,"hospital, so lots of people but little service. ryan screamed at a few of them, shaking them
"
4482,"into action.
"
4483,"“nine stories?” one of the stretcher-bearers asked, probably wondering if it was even
"
4484,"worth it to carry this heavy weight to the intensive care unit.
"
4485,"the doctor told us to leave the icu and wait outside. damn, i was tired of waiting. i sat
"
4486,"outside on a wooden stool. relatives of patients fighting for life inside sat around me;
"
4487,"mothers, daughters, sons and fathers. i tried fighting sleep, but it wouldn’t work.
"
4488,"ryan woke me up at noon. my entire left side had cramped.
"
4489,"“he is going to make it! doctor said it is pretty bad, but he is going to make it!”
"
4490,"“what? how? i mean really?”
"
4491,"“yes, he fell on his bottom, right into the fountain by the insti building. can you believe
"
4492,"that? doctor said his fat bottom and the six inches of water cushioned the impact.”
"
4493,"thank god alok was a fatso. and thank god they made that useless fountain by the insti
"
4494,"building. eleven fractures in the legs and two in the arms isn’t so bad. given how much
"
4495,"fatso eats, he could probably build his bones back in a day.
"
4496,"“t thought he’d die, i really thought he would,” i said and hugged ryan. and then i started
"
4497,"crying. i don’t know why i did an alok then. it was embarrassing but kind of okay 1n a
"
4498,"hospital.
"
4499,"“is he awake?”
"
4500,"“not much. but mostly because he hadn’t slept for two days. let us go pinch his butt,”
"
4501,"ryan said.
"
4502,"we went inside the icu and saw alok asleep.
"
4503,"“patient needs time to rest,” the nurse said and signalled us to keep quiet. we left the icu
"
4504,"and took a bus back to kumaon.
"
4505,"on our way back in the bus, ryan turned to me. “you know hari, i owe fatso a lot.”
"
4506,"“really?” i said.
"
4507,"“if it weren’t for him, i would have never studied to even reach a five-pointer,” ryan
"
4508,"said.
"
4509,"i guess he was right. it was only he who brought us to our books. and now as he lay
"
4510,"there, we didn’t have any books to study from.
"
4511,"“you think he will be okay?” ryan said.
"
4512,"“he will ryan. he will,” i said and hugged ryan. for the first time, he felt more heavy
"
4513,"than strong. he hugged me back tighter.
"
4514,"“t am sorry hari,” ryan said and his voice sounded like he was fighting back tears, “i am
"
4515,"sorry.”
"
4516,"“tt’s okay, we can get through this,” i said.
"
4517,"all of us needed time to rest. and we had time — four months of it — to take all the rest in
"
4518,"the world.
"
4519," 
"
4520,"22
"
4521,"ryan speaks
"
4522,"iblew it: damn, fatso was in the icu battling to breathe. that really was
"
4523,"disaster, eh? this whole operation pendulum was a mistake — in hindsight of course. it
"
4524,"could all have been different you know. if fatso had just not tried to save a buck and
"
4525,"make that phone call, or better yet, if he hadnt come at all. if nothing else, at least he
"
4526,"should have known better than to jump. what is it with alok, or for that matter, even with
"
4527,"hari? when will they grow up?
"
4528,"now you will say, i really don't want to accept that it was my fault. ryan will blame
"
4529,"anyone — his parents, his friends, his college, even god — anyone but himself. he is that
"
4530,"boy with the grudge!
"
4531,"i don't blame you. you are reading hari’ version. how can he be the bad guy, right?
"
4532,"after all, hari is just a bumbling iitian who can't get his grades or life in order. he is
"
4533,"just kind-hearted and confused — hopelessly in love, physically unappealing, wants to
"
4534,"keep his friends together, fumbles in vivas — whatever, whatever, whatever. can't help but
"
4535,"feel sorry for that guy right?
"
4536,"did it ever occur to you that at one level mr sorryboy has a layer to him that he
"
4537,"doesnt want to unpeel and will not bring up in his, yes that is the key word — his, book?
"
4538,"like he will never really bring up his parents. or if you think he will reveal the big bad
"
4539,"story about why his vivas get screwed up — sorry, no luck there. or why does he always
"
4540,"make fun of alok’s family — i mean it is funny but it isn't what you could call sensitive.
"
4541,"no, he wont go into all that. maybe i can touch on it at least (too much and he'll edit
"
4542,"it right out). but before that, i want to come back to alok. man — you don't jump nine
"
4543,"stories because some old bozos do a disco on you. or if you can't pay for the car that
"
4544,"will buy your sis a loser for the rest of her life. why is he so stupid? if he was so mad, he
"
4545,"should have pushed me instead.
"
4546,"you know what, despite what you might think, i like alok. yes, we fight, we argue and
"
4547,"sometimes i hate his mugger-whiner guts. but at the end of the day, the guy lives a
"
4548,"selfless life. he doesn't really want to get that high average in the quiz. damn, he doesnt
"
4549,"even want to be an [tian (but then, who would). it is something he does for his folks
"
4550,"back home, day after day after day. just as he has been serving his dad since he was
"
4551,"twelve, locked in that room full of books, medicines and misery. that is why he never
"
4552,"grew up. that is why he thinks its okay to — ugh — cry at twenty.
"
4553,"and that is why he never had fun. but does that mean he doesn't want to? why do you
"
4554,"think he stuck with us? or why did he come back? because at one level, he knew that he
"
4555,"wasnt venkat. he was just a boy who wanted to be an artist — and couldnt become one.
"
4556,"and he was a boy who never had real friends in his life — but he wanted them. and when i
"
4557,"saved him from that hideous ragging, it wasn't something that happened to him every day.
"
4558,"so he stuck with me, and fought with me, and cursed me and hated me — while all he was
"
4559,"doing was fighting, cursing and hating himself. i shook his convictions — one didnt have
"

"
4561,"sacrifice fun. i pushed him, he resisted and liked it at the same time. and i pushed some

"
4563,"but hari? him i want to ask a few questions. like whats with your parents hari? is
"
4564,"there going to be no chapter covering that? what about your dad — the colonel in the
"
4565,"army? what is the rule in the house — no tv, no music, no laughing loud? it is all for
"
4566,"discipline, right?
"
4567,"and your mother — she turns silent for days, right? oh, wait a minute, i am not
"
4568,"supposed to talk about that. what about the belt your father hangs in the closet. do you
"
4569,"still dream of that sometimes, hari? he told you not to answer back. if you answer your
"
4570,"superiors back, you will be punished. severely. is it viva-time? does it still hurt, hari?
"
4571,"okay, i think i am pushing it. hari is okay, he just has some issues he doesn't want to
"
4572,"talk about. and just because one writes a book doesn't mean one has to bare all. after all,
"
4573,"this is a book about iit — the place where one makes a future. what is the point of
"
4574,"digging up the past?
"
4575,"so let me come back to iit: hari (with more vodka inside him than he can handle) once
"
4576,"told me his view on friendship.
"
4577,"he said, “ryan, you are stupid to want to sacrifice so much for your friends. in some
"
4578,"ways, it is the same madness that alok has for his family. both of you have lost touch with
"
4579,"what you really want.”
"
4580,"profound eh? so, i asked him if he was in touch with what he wanted. and he nodded.
"
4581,"“what do you want?” i asked.
"
4582,"“to be you.”
"
4583,"“what?” i hadn't heard right!
"
4584,"“t want neha,” he said and passed out, the horny bastard.
"
4585,"so what’ the deal here — he may not live for others, but he wants to be like others?

4586,"confused, i tell you.

"
4589,"two months into our suspended semester, alok finally returned to
"
4590,"kumaon. the casts were still on, and doctors said that even when they came off, he would
"
4591,"be left with a slight limp in his left leg. small price to pay for one’s life i guess, though it
"
4592,"meant alok would never forget that night for the rest of his life.
"
4593,"we visited him daily in the hospital, as we had nothing else to do anyway. we never
"
4594,"discussed going home for the semester. somehow, we knew we had to stay in kumaon and
"
4595,"be near each other. no one really talked to us much. if they did, they only wanted to know
"
4596,"the inside story — what we did, what was the disco like, why did alok jump ete. it suited us
"
4597,"to stick to our rooms and limit our outside trips to the hospital.
"
4598,"alok swore us into keeping his high jump a secret from his family. his bones healed
"
4599,"gradually and after a month he could at least hop-and-walk to the toilet and not embarrass
"
4600,"himself with company there. though docs had warned us not to mention the fall, ryan
"
4601,"couldn’t resist asking once, “stupid or what?”
"
4602,"but alok kept silent. a couple of times, prof veera visited at the hospital. he kept our
"
4603,"spirits high, saying how he would try to get us to take extra course-work in the last semester
"
4604,"to complete our credits. he even unsuccessfully tried talking to cherian on a mercy plea.
"
4605,"prof veera even came to kumaon, to welcome alok back. “so tiger, you are back in your
"
4606,"den,” he greeted.
"
4607,"alok was sitting on my bed, his torso propped up on pillows. “sir, you shouldn’t have
"
4608,"bothered to come.”
"
4609,"“no big deal,” prof veera dismissed and took out a box from his bag, “here have some
"
4610,"sweets. on alok’s return home and for something else.”
"
4611,"alok looked at the box and almost snatched it out of prof veera’s hand. when it comes to
"
4612,"food, fatso forgets all formalities. the box contained kaju-burfi, his all-time favourite.
"
4613,"“you shouldn’t have, sir,” he said, the three pieces stuffed in his mouth muffling his
"
4614,"voice.
"
4615,"“just enjoy guys. thirteen bones broken and home in two months, that is worth
"
4616,"celebrating,” prof veera said, stroking alok’s head.
"
4617,"we were happy at alok’s return too, and now at the box of kaju-burfis. if only alok
"
4618,"would leave the box alone for one second.
"
4619,"“sir, what was the other reason for the sweets?” ryan eventually enquired.
"
4620,"“yes, of course. i have some good news for you guys finally,” prof veera said.
"
4621,"“what? cherian wants to do another disco?” ryan said.
"
4622,"“easy ryan,” prof veera said, “i know it has not been cool for you guys. but this time i
"
4623,"arranged it through the dean.”
"
4624,"“what?” alok and i said in unison.
"
4625,"“you remember the lube project? well, prof cherian never approved further research, but
"
4626,"i went to the dean and said we would like to revise and re-submit our proposal based on
"
4627,"prof cherian’s feedback.”
"
4628,"“t am not working on any feedback from that bastard,” ryan declared.
"
4629,"“will you relax, ryan? sir, why would we re-submit?” i said.
"
4630,"“that is where lies my idea. if they allowed us to re-submit, we will do some more
"
4631,"experimentation in the lab to prove that our lube additives do have potential. in some ways,
"
4632,"doing some of the research at the proposal stage,” prof veera said.
"
4633,"“and?” ryan squinted his eyes.
"
4634,"“and that means you guys can help do those experiments. i asked the dean if he would
"
4635,"allow you guys to work in the lab to revise the work we had done, since it will be a
"
4636,"productive use of your time. and the good news is the dean agreed. of course, on a non-
"
4637,"credit basis.”
"
4638,"ryan snatched the box away from alok’s hands, took two pieces of the sweets, and sat
"
4639,"down to light a cigarette. “will someone explain what will be the point of this? working our
"
4640,"butts off for no reason,” he said.
"
4641,"“there maybe a benefit,” prof veera said, pulling the cigarette out of ryan’s mouth and
"
4642,"stubbing it on the floor, “for one, you could later explain the absence in your grade sheet.
"
4643,"and i don’t know, if they like the proposal this time, you may be allowed extra credit for
"
4644,"this work in the next semester.”
"
4645,"“really?” alok said, “you mean we will be able to graduate like normal students, 1n four
"
4646,"years?”
"
4647,"“wow! sounds like you gave it a lot of thought prof veera,” i said.
"
4648,"“cherian will never allow it. i am not falling for this,” ryan said.
"
4649,"“maybe he won’t. but if the work 1s good and the dean likes it, who knows? at least you
"
4650,"have something to do in your spare time.”
"
4651,"“we have plenty to do in our spare time,” ryan said.
"
4652,"“ryan, will you talk properly to prof veera,” i said. somehow, the disco had changed my
"
4653,"attitude toward ryan. it had become easier for me to tell him things he didn’t want to hear.
"
4654,"he didn’t argue much either.
"
4655,"“tt is okay hari. ryan is obviously mistrustful of everything about the insti. but guys, this
"
4656,"is the only chance you got. and if you do more work on the lube proposal, who knows, we
"
4657,"might get an industry sponsor this time?”
"
4658,"“sir is right, ryan. and we can’t do this without you. it is your project.”
"
4659,"“you guys really want to do this?” ryan said.
"
4660,"“yes,” alok and i said.
"
4661,"“on one condition then,” ryan said.
"
4662,"“what?” prof veera said.
"
4663,"“t get the rest of the kaju-burfi,” ryan said.
"
4664,"“ten o’ clock in my lab then, we start tomorrow,” prof veera said even as we burst into
"
4665,"laughter.
"
4666,"24
"
4667,"will we make it?
"
4668,"neha. the name that did not allow me to sleep nights.
"
4669,"true, my engineering degree was in the dumps. true, we probably pointlessly slaved in
"
4670,"prof veera’s lab mixing one type of grease with another all day. true, i may get expletives
"
4671,"in my grade sheet that would prevent me from getting a decent job. however, none of these
"
4672,"bothered me enough to cause insomnia. in fact, the four months off were great to catch up on
"
4673,"sleep. but the one person whose voice, smell, image, feelings crept up next to me at night
"
4674,"and made sleep impossible was neha.
"
4675,"i tried calling her on an eleventh. she hung up in two minutes, telling me she never
"
4676,"expected me to be like this. i guess for someone she called a loafer, she had pretty high
"
4677,"expectations.
"
4678,"i had called right back, trying to explain in vain how the whole idea was not mine, and it
"
4679,"was stupid for me to fall for it.
"
4680,"“you used me hari. like all men, you used me,” she said. like all men? how many men
"
4681,"had she been with anyway, i thought. what has she been reading these days, some
"
4682,"femina-cosmo crap?
"
4683,"i was just trying to sneak out a major paper. okay, it was pretty sick of me to duplicate
"
4684,"the keys — but i did it only because it was convenient. ryan would have found another way
"
4685,"in any case. i tried telling her that, but she was like “you men just don’t get it, do you?’ i
"
4686,"thought she wasn’t getting it either, but i still loved her like mad.
"
4687,"“and you told the disco i gave you the keys? i hari? you know dad still believes that?”
"
4688,"wow, i was kind of glad cherian believed it. how would neha understand? if they knew
"
4689,"we had duplicated the keys, we would have resembled those real criminals. we probably
"
4690,"were real criminals. but that was not the point. man, why is it so hard to explain stuff to
"
4691,"girls. can't she just get on with it? should i say something dumb that she wants to hear?
"
4692,"“neha, i know i did all those things. but at one level, it wasn’t me. it wasn’t your hari,” i
"
4693,"said. obviously, i made no sense. but that is the thing with girls. give them confusing crap
"
4694,"and they fall for it.
"
4695,"“then why har1? why?”
"
4696,"“t don’t know. can i just meet you once?” i said.
"
4697,"“no way. we are through.”
"
4698,"she hung up after that and took her phone off the hook for the rest of the day. it meant i had
"
4699,"to wait another month, or suffer another thirty sleepless nights.
"
4700,"then the next eleventh came around, and i couldn’t wait to make that call.
"
4701,"woke up at ten the next morning. the eleventh finally, i told myself and left my room
"
4702,"immediately. i had to make my call fast and think up really good lines this time. i was on my
"
4703,"way downstairs when i noticed an elderly lady come up. probably someone’s parent, i
"
4704,"thought even as i couldn’t help thinking she looked familiar. then it struck me — alok’s
"
4705,"mom.
"
4706,"“hello aunty. it is me, hari,” i said.
"
4707,"“oh hello hari beta. where have you all been? i had to come to the hostel because alok
"
4708,"hasn’t been home for two months. is he all right?” she asked, breathing heavily.
"
4709,"“huh? alok is fine aunty. must have been busy with the project,” i said, thinking of a
"
4710,"way to prevent her from meeting alok.
"
4711,"“uncle is downstairs in an auto. call him quickly, we are all worried for him,” she said.
"
4712,"“yes aunty sure,” i said as iran up. alok was sitting on his bed, reading a magazine and
"
4713,"eating chips.
"
4714,"ryan sat next to him, a porno mag in hand, his cigarette filling alok’s room with smoke.
"
4715,"“are you guys nuts? smoking and porn early morning,” i tut-tutted.
"
4716,"“what are you so worked up about? why not do the best things when one is still fresh,”
"
4717,"ryan said.
"
4718,"“alok, your parents are here,” i said.
"
4719,"“what?” alok said as the chips in his hands fell.
"
4720,"“yes, your mom ts climbing the stairs. she sounds mad and worried you didn’t call.”
"
4721,"“you mean she is coming here?” alok said, waving his hands to get rid of the cigarette
"
4722,"smoke.
"
4723,"“yes, and i think she is going to see your broken bones now.”
"
4724,"“fuck,” alok said.
"
4725,"“just stay in bed. we’ll cover your legs with sheets,” ryan said, stuffing the porno under
"
4726,"alok’s mattress.
"
4727,"“can’t. his dad is downstairs waiting to see his only son,” i said and dug into the chips.
"
4728,"it was fun to see these two guys worked up now.
"
4729,"“fuck. fuck. fuck,” alok said, trying to arrange his pillows.
"
4730,"“and i think you should keep the curses down,” i said.
"
4731,"alok’s mom knocked about a minute later. it is amazing how much can get done in a minute.
"
4732,"ryan threw out the ashtrays, pornos and vodka bottles. he also arranged the course books
"
4733,"and assignments on the study table. all dirty clothes stayed hidden in an overstuffed
"
4734,"cupboard.
"
4735,"“hello mom. what a pleasant surprise,” alok said.
"
4736,"“alok. i am not talking to you. you have completely forgotten us,” alok’s mom said as
"
4737,"she put boxes of sweets on the study table. i wondered if it was okay for us to strike at them
"
4738,"now.
"
4739,"“t was busy,” alok said.
"
4740,"“shut up. two months have passed. you haven’t called since that day you called about
"
4741,"dad and didi’s proposal. what happened? you don’t want to talk about our problems?”
"
4742,"“no mom. it is just this assignment for prof veera. it keeps us so busy,” alok said.
"
4743,"“my son works too hard,” alok’s mom said looking at me and ryan, “you guys should
"
4744,"take a break now and then. after all, your jobs are just a semester away,” she said.
"
4745,"ryan and i smiled, continuing to stare at the boxes of food. please aunty, offer them
"
4746,"once.
"
4747,"“alok, you must come home next weekend. look, even dad had to come all the way in an
"
4748,"auto,” she said.
"
4749,"“you took an auto! it is seventy rupees,” alok said.
"
4750,"“so what to do with dad? and after all, my son will be working soon,” alok’s mom said,
"
4751,"“and hari, why don’t you have some /addoos i made.”
"
4752,"ryan and i jumped on the boxes before she finished her sentence.
"
4753,"“mom but still,’ alok said.
"
4754,"“keep quiet. look didi also sent this new pair of jeans for you. she saved her pocket
"
4755,"money you know,” she said, passing a brown bag.
"
4756,"“thanks mom. i'll keep it for a special occasion,” alok said.
"
4757,"“but at least try it now. come get up,” alok’s mom said.
"
4758,"“no mom. ill do it later,” alok said.
"
4759,"“what later? we can change size now if it doesn’t fit. don’t be lazy get up,” alok’s mom
"
4760,"said, shaking alok’s leg. iam sure that hurt.
"
4761,"“no mom,” alok said, clenching his teeth.
"
4762,"“get up,” alok’s mom insisted, pulling the bed sheet off him. she shouldn’t have. for
"
4763,"alok still had the signs — plaster casts covered both thighs and legs. the feet still showed
"
4764,"marks where doctors had done the stitches. it was something even we didn’t fancy seeing.
"
4765,"“oh my god,” alok’s mom said as her face dropped along with her hands. “mom please,”
"
4766,"alok said, pushing her away and wishing she had never come.
"
4767,"alok’s mom felt nauseous and ryan had to help support her back to a chair. i gave her a
"
4768,"glass of water.
"
4769,"“what is going on? will someone please tell me?” she said.
"
4770,"ryan looked at me. it was time for us to leave the room.
"
4771,"“we'll go downstairs. we'll say hello to uncle and say alok 1s in the lab. okay aunty?”
"
4772,"she nodded, her eyes filling with tears. could any male in her family stand up on his own
"
4773,"legs?
"
4774,"“easy mom. it was a scooter accident that night...” alok said as we shut the door behind
"
4775,"them. i was sure she’d know he was lying. a scooter accident with ryan and me perfectly
"
4776,"fine was somewhat unbelievable. we saw her leave after half an hour, wiping her tears. we
"
4777,"stood by the auto, trying to make conversation with alok’s dad. he was in a happy mood,
"
4778,"probably enjoying his rare day out.
"
4779,"“alok busy eh?” he said, pursing his lips.
"
4780,"“yes. they have an important project,” alok’s mom said, sitting in the auto.
"
4781,"“bye aunty,” ryan and i waved.
"
4782,"“back to rohini madam?” the auto driver said, starting the scooter.
"
4783,"“no. take me to the mechanical engineering department.”
"
4784,"“aunty?” we chorused.
"
4785,"“there are things which a mother can sense, even though her son may not talk about it. i
"
4786,"want to meet your prof veera before i go home,” she said as the auto buzzed off.
"
4787,"“she’ll find out. she’ll find out about the disco,” i said, shaking ryan’s shoulder.
"
4788,"“let her. she deserves it,” ryan said as he put his arm around me.
"
4789,"we went to sasi’s for breakfast after alok’s mom left.
"
4790,"“t have to make my call today,” i said.
"
4791,"“is she real mad at you?” ryan said.
"
4792,"“she was a month ago. she’s got to miss me right?” i said.
"
4793,"“t don’t know. what is the whole deal about missing people and not doing anything about
"
4794,"it anyway?” ryan said, and took out a brown envelope from his jeans pocket.
"
4795,"sasi served a plate of paranthas. ryan left the letter on the table and started tearing up the
"
4796,"hot paranthas.
"
4797,"“tt is so different when you come and eat here without alok. there is no frantic urgency
"
4798,"about eating,” ryan said.
"
4799,"“ts that a letter from home?” i said.
"
4800,"“if you say so. where are they now — la or something,” ryan said.
"
4801,"“how often do your parents write?” i said.
"
4802,"“used to be every week, then once in two weeks. now they write once a month,” ryan
"
4803,"said, smothering each chunk of parantha with yellow butter.
"
4804,"“do you write back?” i said.
"
4805,"“no. not unless it is a couriered letter. in that case the delivery guy asks me to write a
"
4806,"few lines right there.”
"
4807,"“so what is the deal here ryan? i mean, they are just abroad trying to make a buck. what
"
4808,"have you got against them?”
"
4809,"“t have nothing against them. i am just indifferent. i need another parantha.”
"
4810,"“shut up. how can that be? i mean, how come you save all their letters? i saw them,
"
4811,"hundreds next to your vodka stash.”
"
4812,"ryan stopped chewing. “it 1s too complicated. i don’t want to talk about it.”
"
4813,"“you won’t talk to me?”
"
4814,"“they are too strange. i kept telling them let us stay together after my boarding school.
"
4815,"but the international business was really taking off then and they had to leave. i guess what i
"
4816,"wanted was never in the picture. so, okay i get the dollar cheque, thank you. but spare me
"
4817,"the we-miss-you shit. if you do, what the hell are you going to do about it?”
"
4818,"“did you tell them about the disco?” i said.
"
4819,"“are you crazy?” ryan said.
"
4820,"“you know, you could join their business after iit. i mean, you know what our job scene
"
4821,"will be. but you won’t have to worry.”
"
4822,"“no way in hell,” ryan said, and clenched his hands. “never. i will open a parantha
"
4823,"shop, become a coolie, wash cars but i am not going to go to them.”
"
4824,"“they are your parents...”
"
4825,"he gave me a dirty look. “so thank you very much. i am going back to alok. you have a
"
4826,"good time with your girl.”
"
4827,"“ryan, could you give up your lube project right when it was about to become
"
4828,"successful?” i said.
"
4829,"“what?”
"
4830,"“answer me,” i said.
"
4831,"“that is the only good thing i ever did in iit. it is my passion, my sweat, and my belief.
"
4832,"no, how could i give it up?”
"
4833,"“maybe this pottery business 1s your parents’ lube project,” i said as i stood up too.
"
4834,"he picked up his letter again and walked away.
"
4835,"“reply to it ryan,” i shouted across the road.
"
4836,"he put the letter back 1n his pocket.
"
4837,"“neha, 1s that you?” i said, even though i was a hundred percent sure it was.
"
4838,"“hari?” she said, her voice unable to hide the fact that she was expecting this call.
"
4839,"“before you hang up, can i just say something?” i was suitably humble.
"
4840,"“t am not hanging up. what do you want to say?” she said.
"
4841,"“t miss you. and i love you. god, i was so close to you and then i blew it up. i wanted an
"
4842,"a in your dad’s course. i thought i could impress him. somehow, in our twisted minds we
"
4843,"planned this operation pendulum. and they did a disco on us, ruined our lives. and now
"
4844,"you also don’t want to talk to me...”” my voice dwindled to a whisper.
"
4845,"“hari?”
"
4846,"“what?”
"
4847,"“t missed you too.” she broke into tears.
"
4848,"i wished i could cry too. but her words made me too happy. i mentally hi-fived myself
"
4849,"and tried to control my elation. keep serious tone, keep serious tone, i told myself.
"
4850,"“oh neha, don’t cry,” i said, probably to make her cr y a bit more. i can’t tell you how
"
4851,"good it feels when a girl cries because she missed you.
"
4852,"“t can’t hari. i can’t forget you. why did you do those things?” she said.
"
4853,"okay, this is progress, i thought. from ‘how could you’ to ‘why did you’ 1s not bad.
"
4854,"twisted they may be, but i did have my reasons. and i didn’t have to give them all now.
"
4855,"“t can explain more. can we meet? just for ten minutes,” i said.
"
4856,"“should we? i mean, dad made me swear i’d never see you,” she said.
"
4857,"now how does one answer that? i tried to think of some rational premise on which
"
4858,"swears to dad could be broken. nothing came to mind.
"
4859,"“t miss you, neha,” i said. when in doubt, be sappy.
"
4860,"“t miss you too. can you come to the ice-cream parlour at two,” she said.
"
4861,"“sure. but on one condition,” i said.
"
4862,"“what?”
"
4863,"“can we not have strawberry this time? i like chocolate more,” i said.
"
4864,"“shut up, hari,” she said, unable to hide a laugh. there, i had done it. tears to titters in
"
4865,"one call. plus, a tiny date thrown in too. i did a mini jig at the public phone booth, which
"
4866,"made the other customers in the shop think i had won a lottery.
"
4867,"“see you then,” i said and hung up the phone. i heard the coin go in. what a wonderful
"
4868,"way to spend a rupee.
"
4869,"neha stayed at the ice-cream parlour for two hours, twelve times more than the ten minutes
"
4870,"she had come for. by the end, i’d told her everything. she couldn’t really remain upset for
"
4871,"too long. i guess it could be because i bought strawberry as well as chocolate, but maybe it
"
4872,"was because she was just happy to see me. we fixed the next date for a week later, and soon
"
4873,"we were back in the ‘fix the next date on the previous’ cycle. it helped me pass all the idle
"
4874,"time 1n the dropped semester. we worked eight hours a day in prof veera’s lab, sometimes
"
4875,"ten or twelve. ryan worked longer, even up to sixteen. he ripped open his scooter for
"
4876,"experimentation, making it a pain to move around in the insti. alok used crutches for a
"
4877,"month and then got by with a limp. prof veera liked the second proposal a lot, and he kept
"
4878,"informing the dean of the progress we were making. he never brought up the issue of a
"
4879,"clean grade sheet or extra credits, but we knew there was little chance until we finished the
"
4880,"proposal. we gave the final draft to prof veera one week before the semester ended. it was
"
4881,"two hundred pages, and from ryan, alok and i this time.
"
4882,"“wow. this is a fat proposal,” prof veera said.
"
4883,"“tt’s literally the whole study. we have isolated the optimum mix already,” ryan said.
"
4884,"“i know. this is way beyond a proposal,” prof veera said as he flipped through the
"
4885,"pages, “i cannot believe the four months are over.”
"
4886,"“me neither. i guess it will be time to attend classes again,” i said.
"
4887,"“and loads of them. maximum credits this time, and i am not skipping any more,” alok
"
4888,"said.
"
4889,"“me neither, right ryan?” i said.
"
4890,"“yeah. pll come along as well,” ryan said, “so prof veera, what do we do with this
"
4891,"tome now?”
"
4892,"“well,” prof veera said, putting the proposal on his desk, “let me take a final read and
"
4893,"unless there are big corrections, i’ll just submit it. good job and take your week off before
"
4894,"your loaded semester begins.”
"
4895,"“and the credit and grade sheet, sir,” alok prompted.
"
4896,"“later guys. it depends on the reception to the proposal. don’t be too optimistic, but we
"
4897,"shall see,” prof veera said.
"
4898,"we left his office, leaving our work of three months. it could get us nowhere, but we had
"
4899,"given it our best shot. the final sem began on jan 5, just a week from now. and six days
"
4900,"later, on the eleventh, was my big date with neha, when she would be free for the whole
"
4901,"day. if she would let me come to her home again, i thought.
"
4902,"25
"
4903,"a day of letters
"
4904,"the first day of our final semester felt as special as the first day of
"
4905,"classes in the institute. we got up at six-thirty for the eight 0’ clock class. ryan took a
"
4906,"shower and then proceeded to carefully comb his hair for the next twenty minutes.
"
4907,"even then we made it before class began. it was prof saxena’s ‘refrigeration and air-
"
4908,"conditioning’ or rac class. he was a senior prof, and touted to be next in line for head of
"
4909,"the department. that 1s, if cherian moved on to something else, retired or just died. none of
"
4910,"that was imminent as of now so prof saxena was content teaching final year students how to
"
4911,"keep things cool. we were the first students to arrive, and he was already in the class.
"
4912,"“welcome, welcome,” prof saxena said, “now this is a surprise. who would have
"
4913,"thought fourth year students will reach early for class.”
"
4914,"i guess he was right. in the final semester, people were more interested preparing for job
"
4915,"interviews and mba admissions. we hadn’t even bothered to see which companies were
"
4916,"recruiting this time, for we didn’t know if we were getting a degree this year.
"
4917,"“good morning, sir,’ ryan said as we took front row seats. we were sitting in a
"
4918,"classroom after four months. a blackboard never looked so great. i wondered when the
"
4919,"class would begin.
"
4920,"“what are your names?” prof saxena asked.
"
4921,"“t have heard those names,” he said after we told him. his forehead developed creases as
"
4922,"he tried to remember.
"
4923,"“we had a disco last semester, sir. you were part of the committee,” ryan said.
"
4924,"“oh yes,” prof saxena said, “yes, the cherian case. so, this must be your first class in
"
4925,"months.”
"
4926,"we nodded solemnly.
"
4927,"“that explains it. so, what is your situation? will you be graduating on time?” prof
"
4928,"saxena said. i couldn’t say if there was real concern in his voice or if he was just passing
"
4929,"time before class.
"
4930,"“we are five credits short, sir. even though we have loaded up courses for this semester,”
"
4931,"alok said.
"
4932,"“how many courses do you have?”
"
4933,"“six,” i said.
"
4934,"“wow. most final semester students do just two. and that too they hardly attend class.
"
4935,"you will be in classes all day,” prof saxena said.
"
4936,"“yes sir. no choice.” i shrugged.
"
4937,"“have you talked to cherian about credits?” prof saxena said.
"
4938,"“prof veera is trying for us,” i said.
"
4939,"“hmm. anyway, the system is harsh. look at you boys, could have got a job even with
"
4940,"your low gpas. lots of software companies this time. but this disco might spoil your entire
"
4941,"degree,” prof saxena said.
"
4942,"a few other students trickled 1n over the next few minutes. i think there were ten of us in
"
4943,"class, while over thirty had signed up for the course. i remembered earlier eight a.m.
"
4944,"classes, how we never attended them even 1n the second and third years. but right now, i
"
4945,"couldn’t wait to learn.
"
4946,"“third law of thermodynamics,” prof saxena said as he got up to turn to the blackboard.
"
4947,"ryan, alok and i took out our pens and jotted down every word the prof spoke for the
"
4948,"next hour.
"
4949,"i met neha a couple of weeks into the final semester. for the first time, i had to scramble to
"
4950,"make it for a date. i had to finish five assignments on the weekend, not to mention revise
"
4951,"notes for the coming minor tests. i couldn’t afford to fail in any course, and somehow i had
"
4952,"this big urge to learn a lot in my final days at iit. but a date with neha was a date with
"
4953,"neha, so stapling my sheets for the ergonomics assignment, i ran out to the ice-cream
"
4954,"parlour.
"
4955,"“twenty minutes late! do you realize you are twenty minutes late?” neha said.
"
4956,"“sorry, this assignment...”
"
4957,"“t have to go back early today. dad’s elder brother and family are coming for dinner. dad
"
4958,"is going mad preparing for them. and since when were you into assignments so much?” she
"
4959,"hadn’t removed hands from hips.
"
4960,"“t don’t know. just don’t want to take any chances. can i buy you an ice-cream?”
"
4961,"“no thanks. i have already had one waiting for you. and with my relatives home tonight,
"
4962,"there will be a big meal. and i am trying to reduce,” she said.
"
4963,"“reduce what?” i asked.
"
4964,"“my weight,” she said.
"
4965,"“really? why? you look great,” i said.
"
4966,"“no way. you should see the girls in my college. anyway, what have you been up to?”
"
4967,"she said.
"
4968,"“classes, classes and more classes. eight to six ever y day. then another three hours in
"
4969,"the library. then another two for assignments and revisions. i am going mad. but what to
"
4970,"do? never had this much course-load before.”
"
4971,"“what about ryan and alok?” she said.
"
4972,"“they are equally overworked. and we’ll still fall short of credits,” i said.
"
4973,"“what about your c2d, the whole cooperate to dominate...”
"
4974,"“that was all crap. it doesn’t work that way neha. i know it doesn’t. i might be busy
"
4975,"now, but at least i am learning something. i am not just cogging assignments and beating the
"
4976,"system. that 1s not what it is about.”
"
4977,"“wow, my loafer has become all serious. what 1s it about then?” her voice went playful,
"
4978,"always a good sign.
"
4979,"“tt 1s about knowledge. and making the most of the system, even if it has flaws. and it is
"
4980,"about not listening to bloody ryan all the time,” i said.
"
4981,"“you are getting all wise. i miss my loafer,” she said.
"
4982,"i became quiet and looked into her eyes. then, in one instant i got up and kissed her on
"
4983,"the lips.
"
4984,"“hari! are you crazy? people know me here,” she said.
"
4985,"“just to let you know the loafer 1s still there,” i said.
"
4986,"“yeah right. anyway, look what i got,” she said and took out a piece of paper from her
"
4987,"bag.
"
4988,"“tt’s your brother’s letter,” i said.
"
4989,"“yes, his last. i want you to keep it,” she said.
"
4990,"“why?” i said. it was a weird gift, to say the least.
"
4991,"“t don’t know. dad doesn’t trust me anymore. and he comes and searches my room now
"
4992,"and then. i don’t want him to find this.”
"
4993,"“really? is he giving you a lot of trouble?” i said.
"
4994,"“not much. i just don’t speak to him much. i did hear him talk about you guys the other
"
4995,"day though.”
"
4996,"“what? where?”
"
4997,"“tl tell you. will you keep my letter then?”
"
4998,"“you know i will. what did he say?”
"
4999,"“dean shastri came home the other day. they were talking about this proposal.”
"
5000,"“the lube project,” i said.
"
5001,"“yes, something like that. prof veera had given each of them a copy. dean shastri was
"
5002,"quite impressed with the findings.”
"
5003,"“what did your dad say?” i said.
"
5004,"“t don’t think you want to hear it,” she said.
"
5005,"“no tell me,” i fairly shouted. why do girls take so long to come to the point?
"
5006,"“he said it was an okay-ish effort. but he told dean shastri not to trust these students. he
"
5007,"said, ‘who knows? they have cheated once, they could have cheated to make the findings.
"
5008,"they just want their credits,’ and that was it.”
"
5009,"“complete crap. that 1s complete crap. you know neha, how much we worked our asses
"
5010,"off on it.”
"
5011,"“t know. but that 1s what he said. and dean shastri told him to think about it some more.”
"
5012,"i put the letter on the table. i spread it out; samir’s last words. someone so sick of his
"
5013,"father’s desire to get him into iit that he preferred death. i wondered how much a train
"
5014,"passing over you could hurt.
"
5015,"“two large bricks of strawberry please,” i heard a voice 1n the background.
"
5016,"“hello cherian sahib. what happened, big guests tonight?” the counter boy said.
"
5017,"“yes, my brother is coming from canada. he loves ice-cream,” i heard prof cherian’s
"
5018,"voice.
"
5019,"i froze at my table, like all the flavors of ice-cream in the fridge. neha froze too. we
"
5020,"were sitting right opposite him, and couldn’t run out of the parlour. we silently prayed he
"
5021,"wouldn’t see us. but this was cherian. a reflection on the steel counter frame was enough.
"
5022,"“neha!” he turned toward us. i think all the ice-cream 1n the parlour melted at that tone.
"
5023,"neha didn’t say anything. i didn’t move. i recalled last seeing cherian when he was head
"
5024,"of the disco. will he ruin me again? i hadn’t even ordered my ice-cream.
"
5025,"cherian came and sat next to me. my heart raced as it attempted to leave my body and
"
5026,"escape the parlour.
"
5027,"“you have guts. you bloody rascal, you do have guts,” cherian said as he stared at me.
"
5028,"neha cleared her throat but he signaled her to keep quiet.
"
5029,"“sir, [ just... sir...just had to...sir just ran into her,” i said, talking and thinking at the same
"
5030,"time.
"
5031,"“are you bluffing me again?” cherian banged his fist on the table. it landed on the open
"
5032,"letter and almost tore it.
"
5033,"“dad, be careful,” neha said as she tried to push his angry fist away.
"
5034,"“what 1s this?” cherian said.
"
5035,"neha opened her palms and covered the letter.
"
5036,"“nothing. it is nothing, dad,” she said.
"
5037,"“what is it, you rascal?” cherian said looking at me, his fist still firmly on the letter,
"
5038,"“love letters you write to trap my daughter. i told you to stay away from her. so one disco
"
5039,"wasn’t enough?”
"
5040,"“tt is samir’s letter,” i said.
"
5041,"“hari, shut up,” neha said, as a reflex.
"
5042,"i don’t know why i said it. but i wasn’t going to repeat it.
"
5043,"“what did he say?” prof cherian said.
"
5044,"neha and i kept silent.
"
5045,"“remove your hands, neha,” cherian said and glared at her. she withdrew her hands,
"
5046,"only to bring them to her face to wipe her tears. cherian picked the letter up and read it
"
5047,"silently.
"
5048,"he tried hard to retain his composure, but his eyes contracted and his fingers started to
"
5049,"shiver. he read the letter again and again and then again. the two bricks of ice-cream he
"
5050,"had bought were melting and creating a puddle on our table. but, the puddles in cherian’s
"
5051,"mind were causing us more concern. he removed his glasses, his eyes then did the
"
5052,"unthinkable. yes, here he was, the head of our department, the tormentor of my life and his
"
5053,"eyes had just become wet. two fat tears squeezed out of the edges. and there i was, sitting
"
5054,"with the cherian family as they cried. i could have joined in, but i wasn’t in the mood.
"
5055,"besides, ice-cream parlours are hardly the place for group cries.
"
5056,"“dad, are you all right?’ neha said, wiping her tears.
"
5057,"her father then cried uncontrollably. it was strange to see a grown-up man cry. i mean,
"
5058,"you expect them to make you cry. i wished ryan were here.
"
5059,"“let’s go home, dad,” neha said as she got up.
"
5060,"cherian surrendered himself to his daughter. i gave neha the bag of ice-cream, mostly a
"
5061,"syrupy mass now. her father kept kissing the letter.
"
5062,"they left the parlour and i hadn’t gotten a chance to fix my next date with neha. but i felt
"
5063,"damn lucky to survive meeting cherian again. neha drove the car with her dad still sobbing
"
5064,"in the front seat.
"
5065,"“sir, are you going to pay for that ice-cream?” the counter boy asked me.
"
5066,"“you mean cherian was in tears. like real crying-crying?” ryan was disbelieving.
"
5067,"“howling man, with hands on face and lots of tears right until he left. damn it, i had to
"
5068,"pay for two bricks of ice-cream.”
"
5069,"“totally worth it. i would pay for four for a repeat performance. yes. even he suffers.
"
5070,"yes!” ryan performed a little jig.
"
5071,"“tt isn’t funny ryan. he must have been in shock,” alok said.
"
5072,"“so? not my problem. but i missed it. if only i was there,” ryan said.
"
5073,"“can we do the assignments for tomorrow then? do we have rac?” i said.
"
5074,"“yes, we do,” alok said, “so what is going on about the proposal?”
"
5075,"“t don’t know. neha told me cherian wasn’t so keen. let us talk to prof veera some time
"
5076,"next week.”
"
5077,"“the companies have arrived you know. i saw the recruitment notice board. many new
"
5078,"ones in the software sector,” alok said.
"
5079,"“no point looking at them yet. if the credits don’t work out, we’ll have another year to
"
5080,"think about it,” i said as we opened fresh sheets to do our assignment.
"
5081,"i slept at four that night. cherian’s face after he’d read the letter swam before me. sure, it
"
5082,"was somewhat funny as ryan said. but it was also sad. how could a strong man like
"
5083,"cherian get like that? what are these tough people really made of? and the way neha took
"
5084,"her father back, she must love him a lot. and cherian must have loved his son a lot, even
"
5085,"though he drove him mad enough to kill himself. do all parents love their kids? what about
"
5086,"ryan? did he love his parents? did they love him?
"
5087,"and then i got up. at four a.m. i had the urge to write a letter. maybe the havoc a letter
"
5088,"had wreaked that morning influenced me. i left kumaon and went to the computer centre.
"
5089,"the twenty-four hour center had students working away on their resumes. the job
"
5090,"interviews were coming, yes, but not for us.
"
5091,"dear dad and mom,
"
5092,"this is ryan. i am sorry for typing this. i just had to write tonight to tell you what has
"
5093,"been going on in my life. and not all of it is good. but if i don't tell you, who else will i
"
5094,"talk to... [kept writing for like two hours. i don’t think i made much sense at all times, but i
"
5095,"did write about a lot of things. about our gpas, our disco, our tainted grade sheets, prof
"
5096,"veera, and our stuck lube project. i also wrote about how they had never really loved me
"
5097,"enough to keep me with them. i kind of knew i was doing wrong, posing as ryan and typing
"
5098,"away his life story, his deepest secrets. simply said, ryan would kill me if he found out. but
"
5099,"i kept writing until daybreak. i thought ’'d done a good job with the text, better than ryan for
"
5100,"sure. when i finally took the printout, 1t was ten pages long. it was easy to fake ryan’s
"
5101,"signature, and his parents would hardly compare for identity. i had stolen the address from
"
5102,"ryan’s room. it took thirty rupees of stamps to mail the damn thing.
"
5103,"“where are you coming from,” ryan said as he noticed me come to my room at dawn.
"
5104,"“nothing. just went for a walk,” i said.
"
5105,"is lying bad?
"
5106,"26
"
5107,"meeting daddy
"
5108,"prof saxena had to interrupt his class that day. a peon had delivered a
"
5109,"message to him, which he read and then turned to the class.
"
5110,"“who are hari, ryan and alok?” he asked, fully aware we sat in the front row.
"
5111,"we duly raised our hands.
"
5112,"“go to prof cherian’s room. he wants to see you right now.”
"
5113,"i tried to be calm, but my heart was beating fast like it had a mind of its own. could it be
"
5114,"the end of the lube project? will cherian hold another disco? will he hand me over to
"
5115,"the police for buying neha an ice-cream? did he realize i paid for his bricks as well?
"
5116,"irrelevant thoughts darted back and forth until we reached cherian’ office, where i
"
5117,"noticed there was a new lock.
"
5118,"inside, prof shastri and prof veera sat next to prof cherian. no one asked us to sit down.
"
5119,"“sorry to bring you boys out of class. but just thought we’ll talk to you while we were
"
5120,"still together,” dean shastri said.
"
5121,"profs together is always trouble, i thought. we maintained a deep and meaningful silence.
"
5122,"“we have gone over your work with prof veera and your proposal, and we understand
"
5123,"you worked on it in your suspended semester,” prof shastri said.
"
5124,"we looked at prof veera.
"
5125,"“yes sir, they worked for three months 1n my lab,” prof veera said.
"
5126,"“now prof veera has made an appeal that we show your absence in the seventh semester
"
5127,"for research work instead of disciplinary reasons. is that right?”
"
5128,"we had promised ourselves not to say a word in that room. it was a simple question, but
"
5129,"we didn’t want any more trouble.
"
5130,"“answer dean shastri,” prof veera bade us.
"
5131,"“yes sir,” alok said.
"
5132,"i never made eye contact with cherian, but his silence was unnerving. why wasn’t the
"
5133,"kingpin in all this saying anything?
"
5134,"“then i guess you will have a clean grade sheet, right?” dean shastri said.
"
5135,"alok, ryan and i nodded.
"
5136,"“well, the final decision in these matters 1s with your head of department. and you well
"
5137,"know your mistakes are quite unpardonable. but this time, prof cherian has agreed to show
"
5138,"your seventh semester as a research semester.”
"
5139,"“what?” the three of us said in unison. sometimes, even good news can be a shock.
"
5140,"“yes, prof cherian has agreed. congratulations and good work,” prof veera said.
"
5141,"i looked at cherian for the first time. his face remained frozen, as if he was not part of
"
5142,"this room. what is up with him? has he tripped out on grass, i wondered. whatever the
"
5143,"reason, i wanted to get the hell out of that room before he changed his mind.
"
5144,"“thank you sir. thank you so much,” alok said.
"
5145,"“thank you sir. can we go sir?” i said.
"
5146,"“sure. we were leaving as well,” dean shastri said as he and prof veera stood up.
"
5147,"“by the way, how is this semester going?” dean shastri said.
"
5148,"“tt is okay sir. we are still five credits short,” i replied.
"
5149,"“short for what?” dean shastri said.
"
5150,"“we don’t have enough courses to finish the degree in four years. so we can’t apply for
"
5151,"any jobs or admissions,” i said.
"
5152,"“well, did you take a full course-load?” dean shastri said.
"
5153,"“of course. we have packed classes,” ryan said.
"
5154,"“well, again this is a departmental issue. that is why i tell these boys not to get into
"
5155,"disciplinary trouble,” dean shastri said and left the room.
"
5156,"prof veera patted my shoulder and left as well.
"
5157,"“thank you sir,” i said to cherian. i don’t know why i did it, kind of just felt like a good
"
5158,"exit line.
"
5159,"“hari, can you stay back for a minute,” prof cherian spoke for the first time.
"
5160,"“sure,” i said as alok and ryan gave me curious glances before vacating the room.
"
5161,"“sit down,” cherian said and pointing at a chair before him, he got up to lock the door.
"
5162,"why did he ask me to stay back? was he going to kill me?
"
5163,"“so five credits short, eh?” cherian said. so he was listening to what people had said in
"
5164,"his room.
"
5165,"“yes sir,” i said.
"
5166,"“you know if i sanction you all to work with prof veera this semester to follow through
"
5167,"on this project, we could get you laboratory credits.”
"
5168,"now what was that supposed to mean — ‘if i sanction’? was cherian just reminding me of
"
5169,"how much he controlled my fate. hell, i know that sir. i am just excited to have a clean
"
5170,"grade sheet for now. maybe one day after several years i might get a job. can i go now?
"
5171,"“what are you thinking?” cherian said.
"
5172,"“uh, nothing sir,” i said, returning hastily from my thoughts.
"
5173,"“t said i could get you lab credits, that is if you are ready to work on this project this
"
5174,"semester. i know you are already overloaded,” cherian said.
"
5175,"had cherian totally lost his mind? what was he saying? he was offering to rescue my
"
5176,"degree. and if i was ready to do some lab work. hell, i’d live in the lab for the next four
"
5177,"months for five extra credits. i’d eat lubricants for lunch to get my degree on time.
"
5178,"“t think we can manage some extra lab work, sir,” i said when my adam’s apple allowed
"
5179,"me.
"
5180,"“good. let me speak to prof veera and see what he can get you guys to do. if all is fine,
"
5181,"we'll add five credits to this sem.”
"
5182,"“for all of us sir? i mean, alok and ryan too.”
"
5183,"“yes, of course,” prof cherian said.
"
5184,"“thank you sir,” i said, wiping sweat off my forehead. this wasn’t a real moment.
"
5185,"“thank you, hari,” cherian dismissed me.
"
5186,"“for what?” i said.
"
5187,"“nothing. i think you should go back to prof saxena’s class. and start preparing for those
"
5188,"job interviews,” cherian said.
"
5189,"“of course, sir,” i said and stood up.
"
5190,"“and don’t behave in the interviews like you did in my viva,” prof cherian said and
"
5191,"started laughing. i tried to sense if there was malicious intent in his laughter, but he sounded
"
5192,"genuinely amused. i joined in the laughter.
"
5193,"“right sir,” i said and left his room grinning like an 1diot.
"
5194,"we had promised to drink less since the disco, but cherian’s news was huge and worth
"
5195,"intoxication.
"
5196,"“open the second bottle,” alok said, “today i am telling you ryan, open the second
"
5197,"bottle.”
"
5198,"“take it easy, fatso. we still have assignments and lab work, not to mention those job
"
5199,"interviews,” i said.
"
5200,"“how? how did you do it hari?” ryan said, by now already high.
"
5201,"“it didn’t do anything. i really thought he was going mad. but that 1s what he said.” i
"
5202,"shrugged.
"
5203,"“you are awesome man,” ryan said as he came forward and kissed my cheek. i hate it
"
5204,"when he does that.
"
5205,"“which is the next interview then alok?” i asked, pushing ryan away.
"
5206,"“okay guys, here is the deal,” alok said, taking out a file full of brochures of companies,
"
5207,"“we are five-pointers, remember? so a lot of these jobs won’t even short-list us.”
"
5208,"“t don’t care man. tell me any job that will,” ryan said.
"
5209,"“software. that 1s the hot sector this year. they hire in droves and don’t have gpa-based
"
5210,"short-listing criteria,” alok said.
"
5211,"“t love software,” ryan vouched.
"
5212,"“when is the interview?” i said.
"
5213,"“well, a good one is 1n three weeks. what do you say? all of us apply? who knows, we
"
5214,"can all be together,” alok said.
"
5215,"“we will be,” i said and raised my glass.
"
5216,"“cheers, to five credits,” we all said in unison.
"
5217,"the alarm rang at six am. the big interview day had arrived. for the first time that
"
5218,"semester, we skipped the first three classes. the last few weeks had been backbreaking
"
5219,"with prof veera’s lab work adding three hours to the already full fourteen hours a day
"
5220,"workload.
"
5221,"but today was the software company’s interview; the best chance for low-gpa students
"
5222,"like us to get employment.
"
5223,"“wake up, fatso. we need to dress up for these interviews,” i hollered.
"
5224,"“will we get it?” alok said.
"
5225,"“not if you stay in bed,” ryan said, pulling his quilt away.
"
5226,"itians really dress up for interviews. for the first time in four years, i wore a tie. it was
"
5227,"a weird tie, with orange spots on black or the other way round, i forget. but it had worked
"
5228,"for a senior last year and kumaonites considered it lucky. ryan had got a new italian silk tie
"
5229,"from his parents, bastard. for some reason, his gifts had increased the last few weeks. i
"
5230,"wondered if they had received my letter.
"
5231,"ryan’s scooter was now engineless, so we had to take an auto to the institute. we couldn’t
"
5232,"walk and spoil the creases on our shirts and trousers, as ryan pointed out.
"
5233,"“technosoft software inter views here,” said a sign in the insti building. there were over
"
5234,"fifty of us, all students from my batch dressed like we were attending our wedding.
"
5235,"“apparently, half the batch has already got jobs. this is the best chance for the under-
"
5236,"performers like us,” alok sighed.
"
5237,"i tried to think of the day when i had started relating so well to the word under-performer.
"
5238,"was it the first quiz we messed up? was it our first gpa? was it the disco? i guess there
"
5239,"were enough things we screwed up to earn our place in that club.
"
5240,"amongst the three of us, ryan had his interview first, followed by alok and then me.
"
5241,"before the interview, we took an aptitude test. it had simple iq type questions that any
"
5242,"itian could answer after a bottle of vodka in him.
"
5243,"“tt 1s the interview. that 1s where they decide,” alok said.
"
5244,"we submitted our grade sheets. the seventh semester column was blank, with ‘research
"
5245,"absence’, emblazoned across it. the rest of the semesters were pretty ordinary, lots of cs
"
5246,"and ds.
"
5247,"“best of luck, ryan,” alok said as he hugged ryan.
"
5248,"“careful, don’t spoil the crease,” ryan warned.
"
5249,"he came out after twenty minutes.
"
5250,"“how was it?” alok said.
"
5251,"“don’t know. not too great i guess. they only asked about my low grades, and why i
"
5252,"wanted to do this and all that,” ryan said.
"
5253,"“so what did you say,” i said.
"
5254,"“just whatever. let us just wait and see,” he said.
"
5255,"alok went for twenty minutes. it was my turn as soon as he came out.
"
5256,"a thirty-year-old man welcomed me into the interview room.
"
5257,"“hi, iam kamal desai. you are hari, right?” he said.
"
5258,"“yes sir,” i said.
"
5259,"“sit down, sit down. and don’t sir me, call me kamal.”
"
5260,"i sat down quietly. kamal browsed through my files and then stopped at the grade sheet.
"
5261,"“hmmm...5.48 overall, what happened?” he looked into my eyes.
"
5262,"it was right at this moment when i should have had my panic attack. but i didn’t this time.
"
5263,"i don’t know why, but ever since i saw ryan’s plan fail, alok jump and cherian cry, the
"
5264,"whole wide world didn’t intimidate me anymore.
"
5265,"“it screwed up my first semester, sir... mean kamal. and it is really hard to come back in
"
5266,"iit if you miss the first time.”
"
5267,"“that is very interesting. what happened in the first sem?” kamal said
"
5268,"“don’t know. felt like enjoying college life a bit. i guess iit is not that type of college,” i
"
5269,"said.
"
5270,"“yes, iits are truly different. tell me, do you like itt?” kamal said.
"
5271,"it was a loaded question. a question no one had asked me before. i had thought i’d be
"
5272,"quick to say how i hated every living moment of it, but couldn’t. i remembered my first day
"
5273,"— the day ryan saved me from baku and his coke bottles. four years, and soon 1t would be
"
5274,"time to leave this place. did i like it here?
"
5275,"“t don’t know. there are things i'd rather forget. but i met my best friends here, and
"
5276,"hopefully this place will get me a job,” i said.
"
5277,"kamal laughed. i could see him as one of the students ten years ago. i wondered what his
"
5278,"gpa had been in his time. that 1s the thing about iit, you see people and you wonder what
"
5279,"their gpa was. you kind of need that to judge them. sad.
"
5280,"kamal asked me a few more questions about why i wanted to join the software sector.
"
5281,"hell, i'd kiss any sector that would give me a job. and this was my one chance.
"
5282,"“tt was very interesting talking to you. that’s all for now,” kamal said as he escorted me
"
5283,"out of the room.
"
5284,"“interesting talking to you” — i repeated the phrase three times in my head. what was that
"
5285,"supposed to mean? just a polite way of saying i was weird and stood no chance? or did
"
5286,"my pathetic resume file really charm him?
"
5287,"we waited another hour for the results. and that 1s when i realized that for once my luck
"
5288,"might have turned for the better.
"
5289,"“hari, you and i have made it! you got an offer in bombay and i got delhi,” alok said
"
5290,"and tugged at my shirt.
"
5291,"i became numb and couldn’t answer him for the next five minutes. a crowd of students
"
5292,"almost crushed me in their rush to the notice board. i was lost in my thoughts. just a few
"
5293,"days ago, i was planning to spend an extra year to complete five credits and collect a tainted
"
5294,"grade sheet. now i had a way out. and i had a job.
"
5295,"“t didn’t get it,” ryan said.
"
5296,"“what?”
"
5297,"that had to be a mistake. how could alok and i get a job while ryan not?
"
5298,"“what happened?” i said.
"
5299,"“t don’t know. fuck man, fuck-fuck-fuck,” ryan said as he walked away from us.
"
5300,"“where 1s he going?” alok said.
"
5301,"“t don’t know,” i said.
"
5302,"for a couple of moments i forgot my own job. ryan had not got a job? he was the
"
5303,"creative, confident, smart one. he was what i always wanted to be. so he had almost the
"
5304,"lowest grade in the insti, but this is ryan, hello?
"
5305,"“we got a job, hari. six grand a month,” alok said.
"
5306,"“huh? oh, yeah,” i said, suspending my concern for ryan for a while. “so, we’re not just
"
5307,"five-point somethings anymore, we are five point somebodies.”
"
5308,"alok spoke to his parents on the phone for two hours that night. i think he read out the whole
"
5309,"offer letter to them. his mother noted down the entire package — basic salary, travel
"
5310,"allowance and of course, the much needed medical benefits. alok was thrilled.
"
5311,"i was still kind of numb. when good things happen to you, you kind of feel there is
"
5312,"something odd. like this could be a dream. that kamal desai of technosoft will call me
"
5313,"and say it was all a bad joke. and then again, the job was in bombay.
"
5314,"“what 1s with you? you don’t seem so excited,” alok said as he got out of the phone
"
5315,"booth.
"
5316,"“tam. i am. but it 1s in bombay. what about neha?” i said.
"
5317,"“what about her? you’ll still continue after iit?” alok asked naively, as if she had been
"
5318,"part of my curriculum here.
"
5319,"“why not?” i said, placing my fingers in the booth’s grill.
"
5320,"alok shrugged his shoulders. it was pointless talking to him. he would have rather
"
5321,"discussed the dental benefits that the job gave us.
"
5322,"“where 1s ryan?” i said.
"
5323,"“t think he went to the lab. he said he wanted to talk to prof veera,” i said.
"
5324,"“t hope he finds something. i think that is the other reason why i can’t be so fully excited,”
"
5325,"i said.
"
5326,"“tt’s hard for him. he is only 5.01, and the last in class. it is difficult for him to get
"
5327,"placed,” alok said.
"
5328,"“but he 1s so smart. i mean, the lube project is basically all his,” i said.
"
5329,"“gpas matter,” alok said and walked away.
"
5330,"ryan did not get a job for another month. our semester sped by really fast, especially since
"
5331,"we were so busy trying to meet our deadlines. ryan kept applying to companies, but he only
"
5332,"got two more interviews. the last guy in the class always found it hardest to get a job. for
"
5333,"that matter, if kamal desai was not into honesty appreciation that day, i might have been in
"
5334,"ryan’s situation.
"
5335,"“you guys can’t lose heart. ryan, you must keep trying,” prof veera exhorted as we stood
"
5336,"in the lab.
"
5337,"ryan’s scooter engine was running at full blast. today’s mixture had an unusually bad
"
5338,"smell, stinking up the whole lab. i kind of wished this was not the optimal mix for our final
"
5339,"lubricant.
"
5340,"“t can’t prof veera. it is not going to work,” ryan said, looking at the exhaust fumes
"
5341,"coming out of the engine.
"
5342,"“of course, it will. but i do feel you are made for better things than a run-of-the mill
"
5343,"software job,” prof veera said.
"
5344,"“what do you mean?” ryan said.
"
5345,"“t mean you should work in research. what 1s in a software job? you are contract labour
"
5346,"at cheap prices for foreigners. ryan, you really think you will be happy there?”
"
5347,"“t would be,” alok said.
"
5348,"“t am asking ryan. you guys are friends, but you all could want different things you
"
5349,"know,” prof veera said.
"
5350,"“like what? what else can i do?” ryan said.
"
5351,"“would you like to work as my ra?” prof veera said. “research assistant. i can get you
"
5352,"a two-year contract. will not pay a lot, say two thousand a month. but you live on campus,
"
5353,"and you can continue research on lubricants.”
"
5354,"i saw ryan’s face. the rs 2000-number was writ large on his face; a third of what our
"
5355,"jobs would pay us. would ryan be able to accept that?
"
5356,"“tt 1s anidea,” he said eventually.
"
5357,"“tt 1s a great idea. and if we find an investor who is willing to commercialize your
"
5358,"product, who knows how successful you can be,” prof veera said.
"
5359,"ryan looked at me. somehow, i felt he wanted me to make a decision for him. i thought
"
5360,"about it less than i should have, but gave my answer.
"
5361,"“t think you will be happy doing this, ryan. and i am sure you will find an investor for it
"
5362,"one day,” i said.
"
5363,"“t project the market for this product at atleast ten crore. you'll get a royalty of, i don’t
"
5364,"know, say ten percent. of course, if we find someone who invests 1n the factory first,” prof
"
5365,"veera said.
"
5366,"“tl do it,” ryan smiled, “iam your ra, sir.”
"
5367,"“yes!” i said and hi-fived him.
"
5368,"“t guess all of us are officially employed,” alok said, “can we party now?”
"
5369,"“of course, you should. but go easy on the vodka,” prof veera said but he was grinning.
"
5370,"27
"
5371,"five point someone
"
5372,"it was the convocation day, officially our last day at iit. we’d
"
5373,"struggled unto the end, but had finally made it! we had passed all our final semester courses,
"
5374,"finished our lab work and had all secured some sort of a job. it 1s the least any [tian can
"
5375,"expect in four years, but to us it was nothing short of a miracle. i had hardly spoken to neha
"
5376,"in the past few weeks. i called once after i got the job, and she cried because (a) she was so
"
5377,"happy for me and (b) because it was 1n bombay. it is not easy to figure out how girls cry for
"
5378,"two different reasons at the same time. but i didn’t push her much. she also said it was best
"
5379,"we didn’t meet for a while, lest cherian find out and flare up again. frankly, that was fine
"
5380,"with me (even though i made a big fuss) with all these damn courses. i had not seen cherian
"
5381,"after that day in his office when he was stoned enough to pardon me. but today, i would see
"
5382,"him again. after all, the head of the department makes a speech to the passing-out batch. we
"
5383,"were part of the passing-out batch and that was celebration in itself.
"
5384,"alok, ryan and i wore our graduation robes. as usual, ryan looked the best. “i am not
"
5385,"sitting in front. you can’t fall asleep in front,” i protested, as we reached the convocation
"
5386,"hall.
"
5387,"“no, it is our last day. i want to see everything,” alok insisted.
"
5388,"“then get your glasses fixed,” ryan said.
"
5389,"alok insisted on sitting in the first row and we sat down facing the podium. we looked
"
5390,"back at the guests’ gallery.
"
5391,"“that is my mom and didi in the aisle. see dad is there, too,” alok said as he waved at a
"
5392,"wheelchair.
"
5393,"“your parents are here too, right?” i said to ryan.
"
5394,"“yes, they flew in last mght. i told them not to come, but they did. see, there they are in
"
5395,"the third row,” ryan pointed out with quiet pride.
"
5396,"yes, there they were, along with the parents of three hundred students. the huge
"
5397,"convocation hall held them all, the whole insanely proud lot.
"
5398,"i saw neha. she had come with her father, and sat primly with other faculty families. i
"
5399,"waved to her and ten other profs waved back.
"
5400,"“sit down har1. it is about to begin.” alok pulled me down.
"
5401,"prof cherian took the stage, all the waving and murmurs ceased, and the convocation hall
"
5402,"became silent as a tomb.
"
5403,"“good morning. as head of the mechanical engineering department i welcome everyone
"
5404,"to this convocation ceremony. today we are proud to give a new batch of the brightest
"
5405,"mechanical engineers to this country. i give this speech every year, and i have done so for
"
5406,"ten years now,” prof cherian said and paused to have a sip of mineral water.
"
5407,"“ten years! this guy’s really been around,” alok whispered.
"
5408,"“to torment class after class,” ryan supplied.
"
5409,"“shh!” t said.
"
5410,"“and every year i make a similar speech, congratulating our best students and talking
"
5411,"about how they should continue to achieve in the future. in fact, i make the speech by looking
"
5412,"at what i said last year. however, this year i am going to do something different. in fact, i
"
5413,"don’t even have a written speech. i just want to tell you a story.”
"
5414,"a murmur threaded through the crowd. no one expected cherian to tell stories. announce
"
5415,"the toppers, wish everyone the best and close it. what was going on?
"
5416,"“once upon a time there was a student in iit. he was very bright, and this 1s true, his
"
5417,"gpa was 10.00 after four years. he didn’t have a lot of friends, as to keep such a high gpa,
"
5418,"you only have so much time for friends.”
"
5419,"the crowd dutifully chuckled.
"
5420,"“but he did have classmates. classmates who this bright boy thought were less smart than
"
5421,"him, classmates who were selfish and wanted to make the most money or go to the usa
"
5422,"with minimum effort. and the classmates did exactly that. they went to work for
"
5423,"multinationals and some went abroad. some of them opened their own companies in the
"
5424,"usa — mostly in computers and software. this was twenty years ago mind you, so
"
5425,"computers were a very new thing.”
"
5426,"prof cherian paused again for water.
"
5427,"“what is his point?” alok said.
"
5428,"“t don’t know. i told you not to sit in the front row. we can’t even sleep now,” ryan said.
"
5429,"“but the bright boy stayed behind. because he had principles. he did not want to use his
"
5430,"education for selfish personal gain. he wanted to help the country. he wanted to do
"
5431,"research and he stayed back at iit. of course, getting a research project approved in iit is
"
5432,"harder than inventing the telephone,” prof cherian said as the faculty in the audience smiled.
"
5433,"“so our bright boy was disappointed. he still kept trying but apart from being a
"
5434,"professor, there isn’t much one could achieve here. ten years passed, when his friends from
"
5435,"college visited home. one of them had a gpa of seven point something, and he had his own
"
5436,"software company. the turnover had reached two hundred million dollars. another friend
"
5437,"was heading a toothpaste mnc, and came in a bmw. of course, this didn’t bother the
"
5438,"principled bright boy. or so he thought.
"
5439,"“as you guessed, that bright boy was me. and at that time i thought it didn’t matter if
"
5440,"others had achieved more personally. i was still the one with the better gpa, the smarter
"
5441,"one, the brighter one. somehow, on that day, i decided my son must get into iit. i wanted
"
5442,"him to carry on my family’s strong intellectual tradition. strong intellectual tradition — that is
"
5443,"what i called it. but it was just my big ego. my son wanted to be a lawyer, hated maths. i
"
5444,"hated him for hating maths. i pushed him just as i pushed students in my class. he failed to
"
5445,"get in the first time and i made life hell for him. he failed a second time and i made his life
"
5446,"an even bigger hell. then he failed to get in the third time. and this time, he killed himself.”
"
5447,"the crowd gasped. students and even some of the faculty members started whispering.
"
5448,"“you all know that i have a daughter. but i also had a son, who died in a rail track
"
5449,"accident five years ago. at that time, we thought it was an accident. but this...” cherian
"
5450,"said as he pulled out samir’s letter, “1s my son’s letter i got only a few weeks ago. he wrote
"
5451,"this to my daughter on the day he died. he killed himself because he did not get into iit. he
"
5452,"killed himself because of me,” cherian said and paused for a long time. he removed his
"
5453,"spectacles and wiped his eyes. the audience was silent enough to hear cherian’s mild sobs.
"
5454,"“he 1s crying,” ryan said.
"
5455,"“t told you. this 1s nothing compared to...” i stopped as cherian began again.
"
5456,"“t am sorry everyone for bringing up this sad story on your special day. i told myself that
"
5457,"if | admit to my mistake publicly, perhaps my son will forgive me. and i wanted to thank the
"
5458,"one student in this class because of who i found out the truth. it 1s my daughter’s boyfriend —
"
5459,"hari. and he 1s here sitting right 1n the front row.”
"
5460,"“wow!” alok and ryan said in unison. all eyes turned to me. i have never been so
"
5461,"embarrassed in my life. this is not the limelight one wants. i wished he’d just move on from
"
5462,"here, but he didn’t.
"
5463,"“let me tell you something about this boy hari and his friends alok and ryan. they are
"
5464,"the under-performers. that is what i used to call students with low gpas. and they do have
"
5465,"a low gpa — five point something is low, right?’ cherian asked in a jestful manner.
"
5466,"“my daughter found it easier to trust hari with the letter. she defied me, lied to me and
"
5467,"ignored me just to meet him. somewhere down the line, this perfect ten-gpa professor
"
5468,"standing in front of you had gone wrong. really wrong.”
"
5469,"i sat back, listening to cherian carefully. i kind of felt sad and for the first time felt he just
"
5470,"may have a heart.
"
5471,"“and that 1s when i realized that gpas make a good student, but not a good person. we
"
5472,"judge people here by their gpa. if you are a nine, you are the best. if you are a five, you are
"
5473,"useless. i used to despise the low gpas so much that when ryan submitted a research
"
5474,"proposal on lubricants, i judged it without even reading it. but these boys have something
"
5475,"really promising. i saw the proposal the second time. i can tell you, any investor who
"
5476,"invests 1n this will earn a rainbow.”
"
5477,"“did you hear that hari?” ryan said.
"
5478,"i nodded.
"
5479,"“anyway, this 1s my message to all you students as you find your future. one, believe in
"
5480,"yourself, and don’t let a gpa, performance review or promotion 1n a job define you. there
"
5481,"is more to life than these things — your family, your friends, your internal desires and goals.
"
5482,"and the grades you get in dealing with each of these areas will define you as a person.
"
5483,"“two, don’t judge others too quickly. i thought my son was useless because he didn’t get
"
5484,"into iit. i tell you what, i was a useless father. it is great to get into iit, but it 1s not the end
"
5485,"of the world if you don’t. all of you should be proud to have the iit tag, but never ever
"
5486,"judge anyone who is not from this institute — that alone can define the greatness of this
"
5487,"institute.”
"
5488,"the crowd responded with wild applause.
"
5489,"“and lastly, don’t take yourself too seriously. we professors are to be blamed even more
"
5490,"for this. life is too short, enjoy yourself to the fullest. one of the best parts of campus life is
"
5491,"the friends you make. and make sure you make them for life. yes, i have heard the stories.
"
5492,"sometimes i wish i had had a friend, even if that meant a lower gpa. it must be good to
"
5493,"have vodka on top of the institute roof at night.”
"
5494,"cherian got a standing ovation.
"
5495,"the applause got louder, in fact it was right under my ears, on my shoulder.
"
5496,"“wake up you lazy bozo,” ryan said, clapping my shoulder so hard my dream paused and
"
5497,"faded out like a defective videotape.
"
5498,"“what?” i rubbed my eyes.
"
5499,"“yes, it 1s me. so tell me mr hari, how does it feel to miss your convocation after you
"
5500,"make all this effort to get into iit.” that was ryan’s cocky voice all right.
"
5501,"“what the...what time is it?” i craned my neck to look at the alarm clock. it said seven
"
5502,"a.m, clearly in contrast to the sun outside.
"
5503,"“looks like your clock has also had enough of this place. it is past eleven. both of us
"
5504,"slept through our convocation,” ryan said wryly.
"
5505,"i got out of bed and went outside to the balcony; the hostel was empty.
"
5506,"damn, i had slept through graduation day. worse, cherian had not really cried.
"
5507,"“fuck!” i said, borrowing ryan’s vocabulary. “fuck. does that mean they’ll not give us
"
5508,"the degree?”
"
5509,"“of course they will. just means we weren’t there when the rest of the class shook hands
"
5510,"with cherian and parents applauded.”
"
5511,"i wondered if it made sense to brush my teeth or eat at sasi’s first.
"
5512,"“sasi’s?” ryan read my mind.
"
5513,"man, four years of freaking craziness to get a degree, and when the time came to collect,
"
5514,"ryan and i sat in our pajamas circling our paranthas with dabs of butter. i really don’t
"
5515,"deserve this degree!
"
5516,"“hari, you know dad said he wants to invest in the lubricant project. he is in touch with
"
5517,"prof veera,” ryan said as sasi looked at us slyly. even he knew we should have been at the
"
5518,"convocation.
"
5519,"“that is great.”
"
5520,"“tt’s crap. i told them i don’t want their money,” ryan said.
"
5521,"“are you an idiot?”
"
5522,"“and then guess what they said? they said they thought i would be okay because of that
"
5523,"letter,” ryan said.
"
5524,"“what letter?” i said, struggling to keep a straight face.
"
5525,"“this letter,” ryan said and took out a fat envelope, “and guess what i noticed on the
"
5526,"cover?”
"
5527,"yep, there it was. the thirty bucks of postage that i put on it was stamped all over.
"
5528,"“so you wrote to them?” i said, still appearing as casual as i could.
"
5529,"“okay mr hari, will you give it up. you made all the effort of typing the damn thing,
"
5530,"could you at least have been careful while writing the address? this scrawny handwriting
"
5531,"of yours is a dead giveaway,” ryan said.
"
5532,"“what?” i said. crap, i should have thought of that.
"
5533,"ryan got up and mock punched me several times over. “you ass, when did you become so
"
5534,"senti?” he said as i wriggled my way out of his punches. we burst out laughing. i looked into
"
5535,"his eyes. he wasn’t mad, maybe even a bit glad. but that changed fast into a serious
"
5536,"expression. yes, ryan will never admit to wanting this.
"
5537,"“you shouldn’t have,” he said.
"
5538,"“oh well, i must have been drunk that day. and i do think your parents are nice. anyway,
"
5539,"it is a good project. your dad will probably make money out of it.” the big picture, that’s
"
5540,"what i should focus on, not spoil things with paltry confidences on letter-writing.
"
5541,"“t am sure he will. prof veera accepted his funding.”
"
5542,"“prof veera knows what he 1s doing,” i said wisely. “when the hell will alok come
"
5543,"back? do you think we missed much?”
"
5544,"“all convos are the same. cherian gives medals to nine pointers. five-pointers collect
"
5545,"their degrees in the background like extras,” ryan shrugged.
"
5546,"i saw a silhouette limping towards us from a distance.
"
5547,"“alok!” i shouted.
"
5548,"“you fuckers! chomping paranthas while the country got another batch of engineers,”
"
5549,"alok said.
"
5550,"“whatever fatso, you want one or not?” ryan said, making the rare gesture of offering his
"
5551,"plate.
"
5552,"“of course i do. after all that cherianspeak for an hour,” alok said, putting out his tongue
"
5553,"to indicate extreme exhaustion.
"
5554,"“where are the parents?” ryan said.
"
5555,"“invited to the faculty club for lunch. i came back looking for you,” alok said.
"
5556,"“did cherian talk a lot? you know i was dreaming of him,” i said.
"
5557,"“really? and i thought you only dreamt of his daughter wearing nothing,” ryan teased.
"
5558,"“shut up.” i turned to alok. “so what did he say?”
"
5559,"“nothing. just the same i[tians-are-the-best crap. though he did mention one thing,”
"
5560,"alok said.
"
5561,"“what?” ryan and i cried in unison.
"
5562,"“that we need to look at the system. sometimes the pressure is too much. something
"
5563,"about lesser tests and more projects etc. didn’t really follow it — i was dozing off a bit you
"
5564,"know,” alok said “you suck man,” ryan said, subsiding back into his seat.
"
5565,"“yeah right. at least i made it on my last day of iit,” alok said virtuously.
"
5566,"last day, alok’s words resonated in my mind. man, how we had waited for this to get
"
5567,"over. and finally it had. maybe not in style, maybe not with standing ovations or medals, but
"
5568,"in our pajamas and eating paranthas at a street-side vendor, we had made it. yes, the three
"
5569,"of us were iit graduates. not the ones that would make it to the cover of time magazine,
"
5570,"but at least we could be called survivors. “yes, it was over!” i tried telling myself — but at
"
5571,"one level, it felt sad.
"
5572,"“tt really is over then, eh?” ryan echoed my thoughts.
"
5573,"“yes it is. time to enter the real world — as they said at the convo,” alok said, showing
"
5574,"off.
"
5575,"i wish i had never met neha. separating from her would hurt.
"
5576,"“have you talked to neha?” ryan asked, uncannily reading my mind.
"
5577,"“t will. we are meeting tonight,” i said casually.
"
5578,"“does cherian know?” alok said
"
5579,"“t don’t think so,” i said. he may have relented here and there, but me and neha together
"
5580,"was still a no-no.
"
5581,"“and what about us?” ryan said.
"
5582,"we looked at each other. hell, this was going to be hard. why is it that when the bad
"
5583,"things about iit come to an end, the good things end as well. it sucks to leave the hostel, to
"
5584,"not be able to see your friends every day.
"
5585,"“we'll be friends. for fucking forever and ever,” i vowed filmily and got up to give a
"
5586,"group hug.
"
5587,"“enough guys, this is a decent establishment,” ryan said and we sat back, laughing an
"
5588,"embarrassed laugh.
"
5589,"that was the last time we were together at iit. after that, our lives changed. but i don’t
"
5590,"really want to get into all that. this is an iit book after all.
"
5591,"and i didn’t know what would happen between neha and me. i mean i could tell you now
"
5592,"what happened, but i don’t really want to go into all that either.
"
5593,"yes, that night we met and said we loved each other and other sappy stuff. and we talked
"
5594,"about practical things like how to stay in touch and we promised to keep meeting forever
"
5595,"and ever.
"
5596,"but forever is a long time you know, even longer than the four years at iit. a lot can
"
5597,"happen between now and forever, and it will — it 1s just not something we have to talk about
"
5598,"in this book. the convocation was over. our bags were packed, and that was the last time
"
5599,"the three of us were together in iit.
"
5600,"alok started his job in delhi, and with no ryan and me to bother him, totally immersed
"
5601,"himself in it. as a result, his software company sent him to the us for six months. the us
"
5602,"assignment earned him a dollar stipend that in one stroke wiped out his family woes. a
"
5603,"spanking new car arrived at the guptas, and i was tempted to consider marrying his sister.
"
5604,"alok’s father got a full-time nurse, and his mother is considering leaving her job to do
"
5605,"private tuitions. i think she needs to keep a job just to keep sane, but who listens to me?
"
5606,"ryan worked with prof veera, and with all that cash from his dad, is investing in a
"
5607,"factory about two hours from delhi. local villagers from nearby have been hired for
"
5608,"construction, including some women. sick bastard that he is, he often goes there to check
"
5609,"them out. i think he fancies someone called roopkunwar more than the others — and i think
"
5610,"there 1s a disaster waiting to happen.
"
5611,"i went off to bombay and, like most responsibilities in my life, hated it. i can’t live in
"
5612,"cramped cities, and i can’t stay away from neha. in the first three months, half of my salary
"
5613,"went in rent for a pigeonhole in the siberian end of town. the other half went mostly in
"
5614,"phone calls to neha.
"
5615,"god, i missed her — her hair, her laugh, her eyes, her holding my hand and everything
"
5616,"else. sure, i missed ryan and alok as well, but it was not the same. i pined for neha.
"
5617,"she finished her fashion design course and had an offer to work for a local designer. i
"
5618,"think she is trying to find something here in bombay. it should work out, given this city 1s so
"
5619,"fashion crazy.
"
5620,"meanwhile, next month i am going to delhi for alok’s didi’s wedding. all of us will be
"
5621,"there — alok, ryan, neha and me. and that 1s what is keeping me going for now. you know,
"
5622,"it is strange, i might have passed out of iit, but in some ways, my soul ts still there. maybe
